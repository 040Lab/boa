### IMPORTANT!
#
* Don't run both installers via sudo. You must be logged in as root. Or sudo -i first.
* Don't run any system updates manually before running Barracuda upgrade.
* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!

$ barracuda up-stable
