# Allan Hoffmeister - aria2c support
# Abhishek Sharma - aria2c with proxy support
# Richard Klien - Autocompletion, Download Size Checking (made for on ubuntu, untested on other distros)
# Patrick Kramer Ruiz - suggestions - see Suggestions.txt
# Sergio Silva - test to see if axel is installed, root detection/sudo autorun

# Use this just like apt-get for faster package downloading.

# Check for proper priveliges
[ "`whoami`" = root ] || exec sudo "$0" "$@"

# Test if the axel is installed
if [ ! -x /usr/bin/axel ]
    apt-get install axel -y --force-yes

# If the user entered arguments contain upgrade, install, or dist-upgrade
if echo "$@" | grep -q "upgrade\|install\|dist-upgrade"; then

  # Go into the directory apt-get normally puts downloaded packages
  cd /var/cache/apt/archives/;

  # Have apt-get print the information, including the URI's to the packages
  # Strip out the URI's, and download the packages with Axel for speediness
  # I found this regex elsewhere, showing how to manually strip package URI's you may need...thanks to whoever wrote it
