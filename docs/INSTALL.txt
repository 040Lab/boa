### IMPORTANT
#
* Don't run both installers via sudo. You must be logged in as root. Or sudo -i first.
* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer. You should use vanilla system.


### Installing Barracuda (main system and core Aegir instance):
#
$ cd; wget http://code.aegir.cc/aegir/barracuda-octopus/blobs/raw/master/BARRACUDA.sh.txt
$ cd; nano BARRACUDA.sh.txt (edit your e-mail address, IP and hostname)
$ cd; bash BARRACUDA.sh.txt


### Optional: If in addition you want a separate instance of Aegir preloaded with platforms
#             you will need to run OCTOPUS.sh.txt after running BARRACUDA.sh.txt
#
$ cd; wget http://code.aegir.cc/aegir/barracuda-octopus/blobs/raw/master/OCTOPUS.sh.txt
$ cd; nano OCTOPUS.sh.txt (edit your e-mail address, username and domain name)
$ cd; bash OCTOPUS.sh.txt
