Hello,

Welcome to your new Aegir control panel for easy Drupal
site deployment.

Your Aegir control panel [version 1.0-boa-T-2] is available at:

 https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

Note:

  Your Aegir control panel is using self-signed SSL certificate,
  so your browser can display warning. Please add this certificate
  as accepted in your system settings to avoid displaying it
  each time you are trying to log in.


The following topics are covered within this email:

1. Logging into your Aegir control panel
2. Deploying Aegir default web sites
3. Setting up search with Solr
4. Adding modules & themes
5. Advanced user information


Please read this e-mail in its entirety. It contains
important information required to properly leverage
all your available Aegir features.


----------------------------------------
#1 LOGGING INTO YOUR AEGIR CONTROL PANEL
----------------------------------------

To gain access, please visit your control panel site
using one-time login link you should receive shortly
in a separate e-mail.

Once in your control panel, you'll find a number of
Drupal distributions ready to deploy [Mini + Classic + TG]:
 
 Drupal 7.0 ------------------- http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0
 Drupal 6.20 ------------------ http://pressflow.org
 Open Atrium 1.0-beta10 6.20 -- http://openatrium.com
 Managing News 1.2 6.20 ------- http://managingnews.com
 Feature Server 6.20 ---------- http://bit.ly/fserver
 Acquia 6.20 ------------------ http://bit.ly/acquiadrupal
 Ubercart 6.20 ---------------- http://ubercart.org

Some new platforms are supported by Aegir Classic and TG only:

 OpenPublic 7.0-beta1 --------- http://openpublicapp.com
 Drupal Commerce 7.0-dev ------ http://drupalcommerce.org
 NodeStream ------------------- http://nodestream.org
 Drupal Commons 1.4 ----------- http://acquia.com/drupalcommons
 OpenScholar 2.0-beta10 ------- http://openscholar.harvard.edu
 ProsePoint 0.37 -------------- http://prosepoint.org
 Acquia 7.0 ------------------- http://bit.ly/acquiadrupal

  Q: How to upgrade from Aegir Mini to Classic?
  
  A: Place a new order at http://omega8.cc/hosted-aegir
     and your old subscription will be cancelled
     plus any unused amount refunded the same day.

  Q: How to upgrade from Aegir Mini or Classic to Aegir TG?
  
  A: Aegir TG is a special, very high performance option,
     hosted on the high-end hardware in a separate custom
     cloud, so simple upgrade is not possible. Separate
     subscription and site migration will be required.

All 6.x platforms have been enhanced using Pressflow Drupal core.
More details about Pressflow Drupal are here:

 http://pressflow.org

Every Open Atrium platform comes with a ready-to-use bonus
feature - Atrium Reader - a mini version of Managing News.
You can see it in action here: http://bit.ly/atriumreader

Another great Open Atrium feature is the default
Apache Solr Search integration. You can use it with any
remotely hosted Solr service, including our own hosted
version - learn more here:

 http://omega8.cc/apache-solr-search-order

Hosted Open Atrium 1.0-beta10 now includes new Ideation feature:

 http://bit.ly/oaideation


----------------------------------------
#2. DEPLOYING YOUR WEB SITES
----------------------------------------

The best way to get started is simply to log into the
control panel and start testing how Aegir works. We're
always ready to assist and guide you step by step, so please
don't hesitate to ask questions - we would love to help you!

Creating a new site is as easy as clicking the Add Site tab.

To make a site "live" using any domain name you manage, you
need to point its A or CNAME DNS record to your VPS address,
like below:

 yourdomain.com.           IN  A      166.84.6.231
  or
 subdomain.yourdomain.com. IN  CNAME  aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz.

You can also use any subdomain in *.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz to create
test sites, for example: http://atrium.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz etc.


----------------------------------------
#3. SETTING UP SEARCH WITH SOLR
----------------------------------------

One Apache Solr Core is available free with every hosted
Aegir server, when paid yearly.

Contact our support department to associate the Solr search
with your desired site.


----------------------------------------
#4. ADDING MODULES & THEMES
----------------------------------------

To add modules/themes to any of the enabled platforms,
you need to log into your FTPS/SSH account:

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTP access.

We recommend using SSH keys instead of password.

It is highly recommended you use only SSL/TLS connections for FTPS.
Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.


----------------------------------------
#5. ADVANCED USER INFORMATION
----------------------------------------


=== IMPORTANT DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Your home directory shows a number of subdirectories, each
one for a different platforms release, while each platform can
include modules/themes in a separate, standard multisite
directory tree.


=== IMPORTANT CUSTOM PLATFORM INFORMATION

When logged in via FTPS or SSH you'll find a subdirectory
named 'static'. This is the place to upload your optional
custom Drupal platform, each in a separate directory,
named in the form:

 /static/platforms/my-green-platform
 /static/platforms/another-custom-platform

When you want to enable any of those custom platforms, just use
the built-in "Add platform" option in your Aegir control panel.

Please remember to use full system paths. You can check the path
with "pwd" command when logged in via SSH.

Note that we allow only Pressflow core based platforms for
5.x and 6.x Drupal versions.

You can also upload a tar.gz/zip archive with your existing site
(including database dump) and we will create your custom
platform in Aegir and import your site. You will be able
to clone your custom site with a working address in the form of:

 http://anyname.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

in order to test everything before changing your DNS to the
new A or CNAME address.

PLEASE NOTE: Having a custom platform created from an
imported/uploaded site is an add-on service, paid separately or
free-of-charge with a yearly (hosted) subscription. Please
find more details on our website:

 http://omega8.cc/site-import
 http://omega8.cc/hosted-aegir


=== IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT SITE INFORMATION

When creating a development version of your site, you'll
want to work with our optimized caching systems turned off.

There is a speed-auto-switch available for dev/prod environments.
Any site you create/access with *dev* in the subdomain, will have
all caching and css/js aggregation disabled automatically,
while all PHP errors enabled for easier debugging of issues,
including those causing WSOD.

You don't need to rename the site to be able to work on it
in the "dev" mode. Simply add a *dev* domain alias and
use it to access the site when you wish to skip all hardcoded
caching used on the non-dev domain.

You can manage your databases via Chive Manager web interface,
using access credentials (dbhost, dbname and dbpass) available
in every site settings.php file.

Chive Manager URL: https://166.84.6.231


=== IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

To realize the full speed from our servers, you simply need
to enable the module *cache* (it's like cacherouter, but
with chained cache - memcache/redis/db with auto-failover)
for every site you wish to accelerate. This module will
accelerate the site only for logged in users.

We also highly recommend to enable the *Boost* and *DB Tuner*
modules. After enabling *DB Tuner* please add all standard and
extra indexes recommended by the module.

The *Boost* module will accelerate your site for anonymous
visitors, while *DB Tuner* will do that both for anonymous
and logged in users.

All three modules are by default available for all 6.x
platforms only.

There is also one extra Pressflow core module we recommend
to enable: *Path alias cache*.


=== IMPORT YOUR EXISTING SITES TO AEGIR IN 8 EASY STEPS

Hint: Replace USER with your Aegir Octopus system (not ftp) username.
      Your Aegir system username is the same as your ftp username,
      minus .ftp.

1. Upload or rsync full drupal root of your site to static/custom/name

2. Chmod everything with: chmod -R 775 static/custom/name
   Chmod files with: chmod -R 777 static/custom/name/sites/default/files

3. Add platform in Aegir using full system path of static/custom/name
   so it will be (in this case) /data/disk/USER/static/custom/name

4. Create an empty site in the new platform with temporary subdomain
   like custom-name.your-domain.com

5. Move all files from sites/default/files to sites/domain/files
   with: cp -af sites/default/files/* sites/domain/files/

6. Import your uploaded database (or use backup_migrate module) with:
   cd static/custom/name/sites/domain
   drush sql-connect < /data/disk/USER/static/domain.sql
   drush cc (choose 1 to clear all)

7. Rename the site (using Migrate task) to your final domain.

8. Finally, re-verify the site in Aegir. Done!

Note that since we allow only Pressflow core based platforms for
5.x and 6.x Drupal versions, after initial import you should
migrate your site to the Pressflow based platform ASAP.


=== ALWAYS USEFUL HINTS

* Chmod -R 775 all modules and themes when uploaded via SSH or Drush.
* Chmod -R 777 all files uploaded to the sites/domain/files.
* Re-verify the site in Aegir after uploading your modules and themes.
* Run verify task on every site and platform after modules updates.
* Run verify task on site and its platform before running clone.
* Run verify task on site and both platforms before running migrate.
* Use migrate task to rename the site (domain).
* Your FTP/SSH access to platforms is limited to /sites directory.
* If any task is running longer than 10 minutes, contact us.
* If any task fails, send us the task log for debugging.
* To disable Speed Booster per platform, create an empty directory
  with the name "ubercart" (unless you have there the real ubercart
  module), with one empty README.txt file inside, so its path
  will be: sites/all/modules/ubercart/README.txt


----------------------------------------
