It is always highly recommended that you read extensive release notes

could keep track on the progress and learn more about great features
and improvements we have made over the last few years, no matter when
you have started using Aegir powered by BOA:

----------------------------------------
#1 RESOURCES UPGRADE
----------------------------------------

Did you know that even single Aegir hosted Engine has built-in CPU
power scalability which would cost you $640/month on Linode or
DigitalOcean?

Popular Edge Engines now have 50% more disk space for files in all
hosted Aegir instances with active subscriptions. Older Classic/Mini
and Power Engines are not eligible for this particular upgrade.

Plus, now all hosted Aegir Edge and Power instances can auto-scale
on demand, up to 48 PHP-FPM workers per Aegir Octopus Satellite
Instance, free of charge.

Did you know that even single Aegir hosted Engine has built-in
RAM scalability which would cost you $320/month on Linode or
DigitalOcean?

----------------------------------------
#2 BACKUPS ROTATION
----------------------------------------

We encourage you to review our backups rotation policy. It is the same
for years but in case you are not aware it even exists, it is a good
idea to learn how the available disk space for files should be used:

#3 NEW DATACENTERS
----------------------------------------

In June 2014 we have added Chicago (Illinois), to our ever growing
list of available 7 datacenters locations, with Tokyo (Japan) and
Ashburn (Virginia) following later this year. There will be also
next generation locations added in San Jose (California) and
Amsterdam (The Netherlands).

----------------------------------------
#4 AEGIR EXPEDITION
----------------------------------------

New Aegir Expedition option will be introduced once the first new
locations are available. It will allow you to request per-site
migrations between all our new locations, so you will be able to
easily and gracefully relocate some or all of sites hosted to provide
even better experience and faster access to your sites target audience,
with per-site precision, and without the need to multiply your
subscriptions. This should open entirely new world of unique
opportunities, cost-savings and efficiency, and any existing instance
will be able to receive upgrade to Aegir Expedition, very easily.

BTW: Did you know that even single Aegir Expedition Engine will have
built-in RAM scalability 2x bigger than even the biggest options
available at Linode and DigitalOcean, where it would cost you
astonishing $1280/month or more?

We are very excited to be able to introduce new options and services,
thanks to innovations possible in all five new datacenters worldwide.

Stay tuned for more news!
