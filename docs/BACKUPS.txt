  BOA supports automated, encrypted daily backups to your Amazon S3 bucket.

  Note that provided 'backboa' tool uses symmetric password-only encryption.

  It will include all directories required to restore your data (sites files,
  databases archives, Nginx configuration and more) on a freshly installed BOA:

    /etc /var/aegir /var/www /home /data

  It will start to run nightly at 2:08 AM (server time) only once you will add
  five required _AWS_* variables in the /root/.barracuda.cnf file and run the
  special command 'backboa install' while logged in as root.

  You can configure AWS Region you prefer to use and Backup Rotation policy.

  To restore any file from backups created with 'backboa' tool, you can use
  the same script on the same or any other BOA server.

  Please read below for details.


  CONFIGURATION:

  Add these five (5) lines to your /root/.barracuda.cnf file:

    _AWS_KEY='Your AWS Access Key ID'     ### From your AWS S3 settings
    _AWS_SEC='Your AWS Secret Access Key' ### From your AWS S3 settings
    _AWS_PWD='Your Secret Password'       ### Generate with 'openssl rand -base64 32'
    _AWS_REG='Your AWS Region ID'         ### By default 'us-east-1'
    _AWS_TTL='Your Backup Rotation'       ### By default '30D'

    Supported values to use as _AWS_REG:

      us-east-1
      us-west-2
      us-west-1
      eu-west-1
      eu-central-1
      ap-southeast-1
      ap-southeast-2
      ap-northeast-1
      sa-east-1

  INSTALLATION:

  $ backboa install

  USAGE:

  $ backboa backup
  $ backboa cleanup
  $ backboa list
  $ backboa status
  $ backboa restore file [time] destination
  $ backboa retrieve file [time] destination hostname

  RESTORE EXAMPLES:

  Note: Be careful while restoring not to prepend a slash to the path!

  Restoring a single file to tmp/
  $ backboa restore data/disk/o1/backups/foo.tar.gz tmp/foo.tar.gz

  Restoring an older version of a directory to tmp/ - interval or full date
  $ backboa restore data/disk/o1/backups 7D8h8s tmp/backups
  $ backboa restore data/disk/o1/backups 2014/11/11 tmp/backups

  Restoring data on a different server
  $ backboa retrieve data/disk/o1/backups/foo.tar.gz tmp/foo.tar.gz srv.foo.bar
  $ backboa retrieve data/disk/o1/backups 2014/11/11 tmp/backups srv.foo.bar

  Note: The srv.foo.bar is a hostname of the BOA system backed up before.
        In the 'retrieve' mode it will use the AWS Region configured in the
        current system /root/.barracuda.cnf file - so make sure to edit
        this file to set temporarily _AWS_REG used for the backup host your are
        retrieving data from, if they are not the same on both systems!
