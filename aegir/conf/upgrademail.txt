Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.0.2

  https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

We have many good news and a special promotion (25% off) this time.

Please read below for details.

Some new features:

* All new 7.x sites now run on latest PHP-FPM 5.3.10 by default.
  For existing sites it is enough to re-verify them in your
  Aegir control panel to get them on PHP-FPM 5.3.10 automatically.

  All existing and new 5.x sites run on the old PHP-FPM 5.2.17
  version by default and you can't change that.

  You can still choose between PHP-FPM 5.2.17 and 5.3.10 for
  all your 6.x sites - just let us know via http://omega8.cc/support
  that you wish to switch to 5.3.10 - but make sure first that all
  your 6.x sites are fully PHP 5.3 compatible. By default all
  6.x sites still run on PHP-FPM 5.2.17.

* New default platforms with new Drupal core versions include
  either enhanced Pressflow 6.24 +Extra or standard 7.12 core.

  NOTE: before you will try to upgrade any of your sites,
  please read our important how-to:

  Really, please read it to avoid some heavy headaches!

* Both Speed Booster, Boost and Redis/Memcached supports separate
  caches per mobile device, so it is safe to use separate themes
  or content for mobile devices. We use simple logic to determine
  the kind of device and there are separate cache bins for
  mobile-tablet, mobile-smart and mobile-other.
  You can review it here: http://bit.ly/wYz6PG

* Purge module is now enabled by default in all 6.x and also 7.x
  sites. Now Speed Booster works like a Boost - it expires
  immediately the cache for any node/page after it has been edited,
  comment has been added. It also automatically expires the cache
  for the homepage and RSS feed. You no longer need to wait
  up to one hour for Speed Booster cache expiration.
  Plus, unlike in Boost, it purges all separate caches for all
  mobile devices along with non-mobile cache, at once.
  Now you have a good reason to disable Boost and use our
  crazy fast Speed Booster only.

* You can use GeoIP data provided by your Nginx server
  in your custom code or modules with variables:
  $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE'] and $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_NAME']
  to display content or block depending on the visitor's country.
  You can check/review it from your location also on command line
  with: 'curl -I http://your-domain' - you will see GeoIP headers.

* You can safely manage Clients/Users attached to hosted sites
  in your Aegir interface. Make sure that all sites have its
  associated Client! Otherwise this site will be available
  for all Clients/Users you have added. The site can lost its
  association with Client after Clone task if there is any
  non-alphanumeric value in the Client name, like &.

* CloudFlare specific header 'CF-Connecting-IP' is now supported
  out of the box and available as standard $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
  in all 5.x, 6.x and 7.x platforms without any contrib module.

* You can disable both Boost and Speed Booster on the fly
  by adding ?nocache=1 to any URL. Useful for debugging.

* Speed Booster offers now also ESI microcaching, as explained
  in this article http://groups.drupal.org/node/197478.
  This may enhance not only anonymous visitors, but also
  logged in users experience, as it allows you to separate
  microcache for ESI/SSI includes (valid for just 15 seconds)
  from both default Speed Booster cache for anonymous visitors
  (valid by default for 3 hours, unless purged on demand via
  recently introduced Purge/Expire modules) and also from
  Speed Booster cache per logged in user (valid for 60 seconds).

  Now you have three different levels of Speed Booster cache
  to leverage and deliver the 'live content' experience for
  all visitors, and still protect your server from DoS or
  simply high load caused by unexpected high traffic etc.
