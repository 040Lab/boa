### Tue, 2010-09-12 21:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A13.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1.  Octopus now creates SSH/FTPS separate, non-aegir
    account for every non-core Hostmaster instance,
    with limited shell to avoid using commands
    like "drush up" since they should never be used
    on sites managed in the Aegir system.
   
2.  Octopus now by default sends a welcome e-mail
    with some useful intro information and access
    details to the address defined as _CLIENT_EMAIL.

3.  When Octopus is used the first time to create
    a non-core Hostmaster instance, it doesn't allow
    to skip installing all platforms, since it is
    recommended to add all available platforms with
    initial install, for easier re-using the code
    by next non-core Hostmaster instances.

4.  The second and all future non-core Hostmaster
    installs allow to choose one or more platforms
    or to skip adding platforms at all.

5.  Octopus by default honors initial domain used
    for the non-core Hostmaster instance on every
    upgrade to avoid mistakes with using different
    copies of the script for different non-core
    Hostmaster instances upgrades.

6.  Also Barracuda will always honor initial
    domain used for the core Hostmaster to avoid
    mistakes on upgrade when you don't use
    the original version of the script.

7.  Better checks if the script is running as root.

8.  Removed memcache module since cache is used.

9.  SMTP connection test is now optional.

10. Nginx version set to 0.8.50.

11. By defult Aegir 0.4-HEAD instead of alpha13
    is now installed to fix critical issues with
    importing sites.
    
    See also: http://drupal.org/node/907248

12. Solr and Chive are now optional (Yes/no).

13. Added optional install of Collectd monitor.

14. Fixed issue with SSL mode.

15. Better compatibility for upgrades from
    pre-Barracuda Nginx installs.
   
16. Now it doesn't start cron before completing all
    install tasks to avoid breaking spinner.

17. Both Barracuda and Octopus now can better
    support re-starting stopped install/upgrade.

18. Octopus now refuses to run if defined domain
    doesn't resolve yet to the server IP address.
    
19. Octopus now refuses to run on system not
    created initially by Barracuda installer.
    
20. Custom FQDN hostname is now forced (if defined)
    in Barracuda before running DNS checks. 

21. Fix for some missing mime types in vanilla Nginx.

22. Updated versions of Open Atrium, Drupal Commons
    and Cocomore Drupal distros installed by Octopus.

23. Lowered memory defaults in the MariaDB configuration.


### Tue, 2010-08-31 23:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.D

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended because it works!)

1. Upgrade of core Hostmaster instance by Barracuda
   and upgrade of Hostmaster instances by Octopus
   finally works as expected.

2. It is now possible to use Barracuda to install
   environment and core Hostmaster instance, to
   upgrade only environment, to upgrade only core
   Hostmaster instance, or both at the same time.
   
3. Octopus now can separately install and/or upgrade
   any non-core Hostmaster instance or any platform
   on any instance, separately, using detailed prompt
   with version numbers and links to distributions
   home pages.

4. New platform Cocomore Drupal added in Octopus:
   http://drupal.cocomore.com
