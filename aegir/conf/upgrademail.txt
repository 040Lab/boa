----------------------------------------
# Other changes
----------------------------------------

* Forced log-out on browser quit only for Aegir control panel. 
* The auto-cron in D7 now disabled, since Aegir runs scheduled cron
  for all sites.


----------------------------------------
# Also worth to note
----------------------------------------

To realize the full speed from our servers, you simply need
to enable the module *cache* (it's like cacherouter, but
with chained cache - memcache/redis/db with auto-failover)
for every site you wish to accelerate. This module will
accelerate the site only for logged in users.

We also highly recommend to enable the *Boost* and *DB Tuner*
modules. After enabling *DB Tuner* please add all standard and
extra indexes recommended by the module.

The *Boost* module will accelerate your site for anonymous
visitors, while *DB Tuner* will do that both for anonymous
and logged in users.

All three modules are by default available for all 6.x
platforms only.

There are also two extra Pressflow core modules we recommend
to enable: *Path alias cache* and *Cookie cache bypass*.

Your Aegir control panel is using self-signed SSL certificate,
so you browser can display warning. Please add this certificate
as accepted in your system settings to avoid displaying it
each time you are trying to log in.


----------------------------------------
# FTP and SSH access
----------------------------------------

Your FTP/SSH username and password didn't change (unless you
changed it already).

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTP access.

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn (initial)

We recommend using SSH keys instead of password.

It is highly recommended you use only SSL/TLS connections for FTPS.
Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.


----------------------------------------
# Useful hints
----------------------------------------

* Create an empty site in Aegir to import your existing site db/files.
* Use backup_migrate module or `drush sql-connect < /path/to/db.sql`
* Rename the site twice after import to get files paths rewritten.
* Chmod -R 775 all modules and themes when uploaded via SSH or Drush.
* Chmod -R 777 all files uploaded to the sites/domain/files.
* Re-verify the site in Aegir after uploading your modules and themes.
* Run verify task on every site and platform after modules updates.
* Run verify task on site and its platform before running clone.
* Run verify task on site and both platforms before running migrate.
* Use migrate task to rename the site (domain).
* Your FTP/SSH access to platforms is limited to /sites directory.
* If any task is running longer than 10 minutes, contact us.
* If any task fails, send us the task log for debugging.
