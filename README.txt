You can install one Aegir Master Instance on your server using
Barracuda and any number of Aegir Satellite Instances using
Octopus installer.

Note: the 'Master' and 'Satellite' names in the Barracuda/Octopus
context are not related to the multi-server Aegir features.
It is related to the multi-Aegir-instances environment, with
virtual chroot/jail for every Aegir instance.

Barracuda is the main script for the Aegir Master Instance system
install and upgrades, including OS env and main Aegir instance,
but no platforms will be added there to keep it compatible
with all existing and future installs, when you don't need
any ready to use platforms and instead you are using the system
for managing your own imported platforms/sites.

Octopus is an Aegir + Platforms installer (you can interactively
choose the platforms you wish to install on the instance)
and updater only. It allows to install new versions of platforms
with clean directory structure, with code shared between all created
instances, so one vanilla Octopus instance is using only ~18 MB,
while most of the code, which is over 1700 MB total, is shared.

Sharing the code between instances is of critical importance,
because it allows you to dramatically lower RAM and CPU usage,
because most of the actively used code is opcode cached.

With multi-install system you have to remember that all of them
will use the same Nginx server, so you could break the system
trying to install site with the same domain on two or more instances.
The instances will not be aware of other running instances,
so it is your responsibility to use such system wisely.

There is also Tuner script available (see aegir/tools/BOND.sh.txt)
for easy system tuning for development and switching it back easily
to the standard production settings.


### SUPPORTED PARENT SYSTEMS

* Xen, VServer, Linux KVM or VMware based VPS or a dedicated box.
* VirtualBox VM for localhost install - check the how-to for:
  Ubuntu Precise desktop image install: http://bit.ly/boa-precise
  Debian Squeeze desktop image install: http://bit.ly/boa-squeeze


### SUPPORTED LTS OS 32/64bit - Minimal on server or Desktop on localhost

* Debian 7 Wheezy (recommended)

* Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 (very limited support)
* Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (very limited support)
* Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 (very limited support)

NOTE: BOA maintainers currently use Debian 6 Squeeze, but for new installs
      we recommend Debian 7 Wheezy. We don't use and rarely test Ubuntu,
      so if you have any good reason to use Ubuntu, don't blame us
      if it will not survive next upgrade. We are trying to include it as
      (barely) supported OS only for those who can't use Debian because of
      company or organization policy etc. But we strongly suggest to avoid
      Ubuntu and instead use Debian, wherever possible, for best results.


### PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED OS (deprecated)

* Debian 5.0 Lenny (automatic upgrade to Squeeze supported)
