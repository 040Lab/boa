Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.2.7

  https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

IMPORTANT! This is the last Edition in the 2.2.x series, which marks the end
of Drupal 5, PHP 5.2 and Drush 4 support. Next Edition will open 2.3.x series,
which will allow us to provide newer Aegir version with built-in Drush 6
support, sites in subdirectories, and many Aegir User Interface improvements.

If you still host any Drupal 5 sites or you are using PHP 5.2 for D6 sites,
you will not be able to upgrade to the next 2.3.x Edition and you will have to
stay on the 'legacy' BOA 2.2.x version, which will receive only system security
upgrades, but no further feature nor bugfix releases.

This also means that from now on the 'legacy' 2.2.x version will no longer
receive Drupal core upgrades, even if there will be security core releases.

It is time to upgrade away from Drupal 5 and away from PHP 5.2, if still used.

There are many new features, changes, improvements and fixes in all
eight (8) recent BOA-2.2.x Editions, released since March 31:

#1 RESOURCES UPGRADE
----------------------------------------

Did you know that even single Aegir hosted Engine has built-in CPU power
scalability which would cost you $640/month on Linode or DigitalOcean?

Popular Edge Engines now have 50% more disk space for files in all hosted
Aegir instances with active subscriptions. Older Classic/Mini and Power
Engines are not eligible for this particular upgrade.

Plus, now all hosted Aegir Edge and Power instances can auto-scale on demand,
up to 48 PHP-FPM workers per Aegir Octopus Satellite Instance, free of charge.

Did you know that even single Aegir hosted Engine has built-in RAM scalability
which would cost you $320/month on Linode or DigitalOcean?

----------------------------------------
#2 BACKUPS ROTATION
----------------------------------------

We encourage you to review our backups rotation policy. It is the same
for years but in case you are not aware it even exists, it is a good idea
to learn how the available disk space for files should be used properly:

#3 NEW DATACENTERS
----------------------------------------

In June 2014 we have added Chicago, Illinois, to our ever growing list
of available 7 datacenters locations, with Tokyo, Japan and Ashburn, Virginia,
following later this summer. There will be also next generation, newer
locations added in San Jose, California and Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

----------------------------------------
#4 AEGIR EXPEDITION
----------------------------------------

New Aegir Expedition option will be introduced once the first new locations
are available. It will allow you to request per-site migrations between
all our new locations, so you will be able to easily and gracefully relocate
some or all of sites hosted to provide even better experience and faster
access to your sites target audience, with per-site precision, and without
the need to multiply your subscriptions. This should open entirely new
world of unique opportunities, cost-savings and efficiency, and any existing
option will be able to receive upgrade to Aegir Expedition, very easily.

BTW: Did you know that even single Aegir Expedition Engine will have built-in
RAM scalability 2x bigger than even the biggest options available at Linode
and DigitalOcean, where it would cost you astonishing $1280/month or more?

We are very excited to be able to introduce new options and services,
thanks to innovations possible in all five new datacenters worldwide.

Stay tuned for more news!
