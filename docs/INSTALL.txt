### IMPORTANT!

* Don't run any installer via sudo.
  You must be logged in as root or `sudo -i` first.

* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!


### Installing BOA system on a public server/VPS

1. Configure your domain DNS to point its wildcard enabled A record to your
   server IP address, and make sure it propagated on the Internet by trying
   `host server.mydomain.org` or `getent hosts server.mydomain.org` command
   on any other server/system.

   See our DNS wildcard configuration example for reference: http://bit.ly/UM2nRb

   NOTE! You shouldn't use anything like "mydomain.org" as your hostname.
         It should be some **subdomain**, like "server.mydomain.org".

   NOTE! You **don't** need to configure your hostname (on the server) before
         running BOA installer, since BOA will do that for you, automatically.

2. Please read docs/NOTES.txt for other related details.

3. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

   $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt
   $ bash BOA.sh.txt

4. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   NOTE: You must specify the kind of install with {in-stable|in-head},
         location with {local|public}, your hostname and e-mail address,
         as shown below. Specifying Octopus username is optional.
         It will use default {o1} if empty. The one before last part
         {ask|mini|max|stock} is optional, if you wish to control Octopus
         platforms install mode, as explained below. Note that none === "ask"
         which is default. The special "stock" option allows you to install
         non-BOA, vanilla Aegir 2.x version, useful for testing/debugging,
         but it will automatically force in-head install, because Aegir 2.x
         vanilla is by definition unstable, unstested and shouldn't be used
         in any production environment, only for testing and debugging.
         The last {newrelickey} part is optional, if you wish to install
         and auto-magically enable both New Relic Apps and Server Monitor.
         It must be a valid New Relic license key - even if it is their
         free Lite option.

   # Stable on public server - prompt for every platform install
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o1

   # Stable on public server - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 + Atrium only
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 mini

   # Stable on public server - no prompt with all platforms and New Relic
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 max newrelickey

   # To install HEAD instead of Stable, use the same commands, but
     replace "in-stable" with "in-head"


### Installing BOA system on localhost

1. Please read docs/NOTES.txt

2. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

   $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt
   $ bash BOA.sh.txt

3. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   NOTE: You must specify the kind of install with {in-stable|in-head},
         location with {local|public}, and your e-mail address,
         as shown below. For local installs you don't need to specify
         hostname and Octopus username, as it is fully automated.
         The last {ask|mini|max} part is optional, if you wish to control
         Octopus platforms install mode, as explained below - none is
         the same as "ask".

   # Stable on localhost - prompt for every platform install
   $ boa in-stable local my@email

   # Stable on localhost - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 + Atrium only
   $ boa in-stable local my@email mini

   # Stable on localhost - no prompt with all platforms installed
   $ boa in-stable local my@email max

   # To install HEAD instead of Stable, use the same commands, but
     replace "in-stable" with "in-head"


### Installing more Octopus instances

You can either run OCTOPUS.sh.txt directly or just run the same boa command
again with new usernames - it will run Barracuda upgrade first and then
new Octopus instance install - automatically.

Example:

   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o2 mini
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o3
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o4 max


### NOTE: You can also configure and run BARRACUDA.sh.txt and OCTOPUS.sh.txt
          directly if you prefer to configure all available options manually.
          To learn more on how to customize your BOA system, please read
          docs/NOTES.txt # Notes related to Barracuda and Octopus customized
          install and upgrades.

          Note also that detailed backend log on barracuda
          install is always stored in /var/backups/*

### Please read docs/UPGRADE.txt for simple upgrades how-to
