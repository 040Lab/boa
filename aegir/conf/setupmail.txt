  to make your standard workflow easier for: -dev, -stage and -prod,
  with correct suffix: D.00x, S.00x and P.00x in the platform name.
  There is no difference between D/S/P, besides the name.


----------------------------------------
#2. DEPLOYING YOUR WEB SITES
----------------------------------------

The best way to get started is simply to log into the
control panel and start testing how Aegir works. We're
always ready to assist and guide you step by step, so please
don't hesitate to ask questions - we would love to help you!

Creating a new site is as easy as clicking the Add Site tab.

To make a site "live" using any domain name you manage, you
need to point its A or CNAME DNS record to your VPS address,
like below:

 yourdomain.com.           IN  A      166.84.6.231
  or
 subdomain.yourdomain.com. IN  CNAME  aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz.

You can also use any subdomain in *.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz to create
test sites, for example: http://atrium.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz etc.


----------------------------------------
#3. ADDING MODULES & THEMES
----------------------------------------

To add modules/themes to any of the enabled platforms,
you need to log into your FTPS/SSH/SFTP account:

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTPS access.

We recommend using SSH keys instead of password.

Note that while your Aegir instance comes with FTPS/SSH/SFTP access,
there is no plain FTP access available.

Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.

You can manage your databases via Chive Manager web interface,
using access credentials (dbhost, dbname and dbpass) available
in every site settings.php file.

Chive Manager URL: https://166.84.6.231


----------------------------------------
#4. ADVANCED USER INFORMATION
----------------------------------------

=== IMPORTANT DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Your home directory shows a number of subdirectories, each
one for a different platforms release, while each platform can
include modules/themes in a separate, standard multisite
directory tree.

=== IMPORTANT CUSTOM PLATFORM INFORMATION

When logged in via FTPS or SSH you'll find a subdirectory
named 'static'. This is the place to upload your optional
custom Drupal platform, each in a separate directory,
named in the form:

 /static/platforms/my-green-platform
 /static/platforms/another-custom-platform

When you want to enable any of those custom platforms, just use
the built-in "Add platform" option in your Aegir control panel.

Please remember to use full system paths. You can check the path
with "pwd" command when logged in via SSH.

Note that we allow only Pressflow core based platforms for
5.x and 6.x Drupal versions.

You can also upload a tar.gz/zip archive with your existing site
(including database dump) and we will create your custom
platform in Aegir and import your site. You will be able
to clone your custom site with a working address in the form of:

 http://anyname.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

in order to test everything before changing your DNS to the
new A or CNAME address.

PLEASE NOTE: Having a custom platform created from an
imported/uploaded site is an add-on service, paid separately or
free-of-charge with a yearly (hosted) subscription. Please
find more details on our website:
