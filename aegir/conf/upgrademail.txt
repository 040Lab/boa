Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.3.0-dev

  https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

IMPORTANT! This is the last Edition in the 2.2.x series, which marks
the end of Drupal 5, PHP 5.2 and Drush 4 support. Next Edition will
open 2.3.x series, which will allow us to provide newer Aegir version
with built-in Drush 6 support, sites in subdirectories, and many
Aegir User Interface improvements.

If you still host any Drupal 5 sites or you are using PHP 5.2 for
D6 sites, you will not be able to upgrade to the next 2.3.x Edition
and you will have to stay on the 'legacy' BOA 2.2.x version, which
will receive only system security upgrades, but no further feature
nor bugfix releases.

This also means that from now on the 'legacy' 2.2.x version will
no longer receive Drupal core upgrades, even if there will be
security core releases.

It is time to upgrade away from Drupal 5 and away from PHP 5.2

NOTE: Since the first Edition in the BOA-2.3.x series is not ready
for release yet, and new Drupal core has been released to fix security
issues, followed by yet another release to fix serious regressions,
followed by yet another security release, we have decided to make it
available to everyone and release yet another stable BOA-2.2.x Edition.

There are many, many new features, changes, improvements and fixes
in all ten (10) recent BOA-2.2.x Editions, released since March 31:

----------------------------------------
#1 RESOURCES UPGRADE
----------------------------------------

Did you know that even single Aegir hosted Engine has built-in CPU
power scalability which would cost you $640/month on Linode or
DigitalOcean?

Popular Edge Engines now have 50% more disk space for files in all
hosted Aegir instances with active subscriptions. Older Classic/Mini
and Power Engines are not eligible for this particular upgrade.

Plus, now all hosted Aegir Edge and Power instances can auto-scale
on demand, up to 48 PHP-FPM workers per Aegir Octopus Satellite
Instance, free of charge.

Did you know that even single Aegir hosted Engine has built-in
RAM scalability which would cost you $320/month on Linode or
DigitalOcean?

----------------------------------------
#2 BACKUPS ROTATION
----------------------------------------

We encourage you to review our backups rotation policy. It is the same
for years but in case you are not aware it even exists, it is a good
idea to learn how the available disk space for files should be used:

#3 NEW DATACENTERS
----------------------------------------

In June 2014 we have added Chicago (Illinois), to our ever growing
list of available 7 datacenters locations, with Tokyo (Japan) and
Ashburn (Virginia) following later this summer. There will be also
next generation locations added in San Jose (California) and
Amsterdam (The Netherlands).

----------------------------------------
#4 AEGIR EXPEDITION
----------------------------------------

New Aegir Expedition option will be introduced once the first new
locations are available. It will allow you to request per-site
migrations between all our new locations, so you will be able to
easily and gracefully relocate some or all of sites hosted to provide
even better experience and faster access to your sites target audience,
with per-site precision, and without the need to multiply your
subscriptions. This should open entirely new world of unique
opportunities, cost-savings and efficiency, and any existing instance
will be able to receive upgrade to Aegir Expedition, very easily.

BTW: Did you know that even single Aegir Expedition Engine will have
built-in RAM scalability 2x bigger than even the biggest options
available at Linode and DigitalOcean, where it would cost you
astonishing $1280/month or more?

We are very excited to be able to introduce new options and services,
thanks to innovations possible in all five new datacenters worldwide.

Stay tuned for more news!
