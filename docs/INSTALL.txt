### IMPORTANT!

* Don't run any installer via sudo.
  You must be logged in as root or `sudo -i` first.

* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!


### Installing BOA system on a public server/VPS

1. Configure your domain DNS to point its wildcard enabled A record to your
   server IP address, and make sure it propagated on the Internet by trying
   `host server.mydomain.org` on command line on any other host/system.

   See our DNS wildcard configuration example for reference: http://bit.ly/IZqv2Q

   NOTE! You shouldn't use anything like "mydomain.org" as your hostname.
         It should be some **subdomain**, like "server.mydomain.org".

   NOTE! You **don't** need to configure your hostname (on the server) before
         running BOA installer, since BOA will do that for you, automatically.

2. Please read docs/NOTES.txt for other related details.

3. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

   $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/versions/BOA.sh.txt
   $ bash BOA.sh.txt

4. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   NOTE: You must specify the kind of install with {in-stable|in-head},
         location with {local|public}, your hostname and e-mail address,
         as shown below. Specifying Octopus username is optional.
         It will use default {o1} if empty.

   # Stable on public server
   $ boa in-stable public server.mydomain.org my@email o1

   # HEAD on public server
   $ boa in-head public server.mydomain.org my@email o1


### Installing BOA system on localhost

1. Please read docs/NOTES.txt

2. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

   $ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/versions/BOA.sh.txt
   $ bash BOA.sh.txt

3. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   NOTE: You must specify the kind of install with {in-stable|in-head},
         location with {local|public}, and your e-mail address,
         as shown below. For local installs you don't need to specify
         hostname and Octopus username, as it is fully automated.

   # Stable on localhost
   $ boa in-stable local my@email

   # HEAD on localhost
   $ boa in-head local my@email


### NOTE: You can also configure and run BARRACUDA.sh.txt and OCTOPUS.sh.txt
          directly if you prefer to configure all available options manually.
