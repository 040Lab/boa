Hello,

Our system detected that you are using vanilla Drupal core
for site $Dom.

The platform root directory for this site is:
$Plr

Using non-Pressflow 5.x or 6.x core is not allowed
on our servers, unless it is a temporary result of your site
import, but every imported site should be migrated to Pressflow
based platform as soon as possible.

If the site is not migrated to Pressflow based platform
in seven (7) days, it may cause service interruption.

We are working hard to deliver top performance hosting
for your Drupal sites and we appreciate your efforts
to meet the requirements, which are an integral part
of the quality you can expect from Omega8.cc.

If you have any questions, please don't respond to this message, since

Hello,

You are using more resources than allocated in your subscription.
You have currently $_CLIENT_CORES $_CLIENT_OPTION Core(s) on a SSD+SAS System.

Your allowed databases space is $_SQL_MIN_LIMIT MB.
You are currently using $SumDatH MB of databases space.

Please reduce your usage by deleting no longer used sites,
or by converting their tables to MyISAM format on command line
when in the site directory with:

  $ sqlmagic convert to-myisam

or purchase enough Aegir Cores to cover your current usage.

You can purchase more Aegir Cores easily online:

  https://omega8.cc/upgrade

Note that we do not count any site identified as temporary dev/test,
by having in its main name a special keyword with two dots on both sides:

  .tmp. .test. .dev. .devel.

For example, a site with main name: abc.test.foo.com is by default excluded
from your allocated resources limits (not counted for billing purposes).

However, if we discover that someone is using this method to hide real
usage via listed keywords in the main site name and adding live domain(s)
as aliases, such account will be suspended without any warning.

Please also note that you can not keep such tmp/test/dev sites forever.
We allow to exclude them from the usage limits only because it is expected
that these sites will be deleted as soon as possible - in a matter of days
or a few weeks, but not any longer. If you will ignore this rule, we reserve
the right to remove ability to exclude tmp/test/dev sites on your system.

If you are using more (counted) resources than allocated in your subscription
for more than 30 calendar days without purchasing an upgrade, your instance
will be suspended without further notice, and to restore it you will have to
pay for all past due overages plus \$152 USD reconnection fee.

We provide very generous soft-limits and we allow free-of-charge overages
between weekly checks which happen every Monday, but in return we expect
that you will use this allowance responsibly and sparingly.
