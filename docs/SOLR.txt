 To enable Apache Solr Search feature for any site on your BOA server,
 please download and enable either Apache Solr Search Integration
 module with required third party library, as explained in its readme,
 or download and enable Search API Solr search module (D7 only).

 http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr
 http://drupal.org/project/search_api_solr

 BOA system supports both Apache Solr Search Integration module
 and Search API Solr search module, but since it comes with
 Solr 1.4 to provide compatibility with both Drupal 6 and Drupal 7,
 you must remember to use correct, compatible configuration files
 when configuring your Solr core(s), or it will not work.

 Both modules come with required solrconfig.xml, schema.xml and
 protwords.txt files in the solr-conf/solr-1.4 directory.

 You should configure each core separately to use correct version
 by uploading respective solrconfig.xml, schema.xml and protwords.txt
 files to the solr/site_00*/conf directory and restarting Tomcat
 with command `service tomcat restart`.

 NOTE: If your site was already configured to use any of those
       modules, you must delete its search index (not just rebuild it)
       or the site and the search indexing will fail to work properly.

 In your Solr configuration there are ready to use 8 separate
 cores, since you need to use one core per site to avoid
 displaying search results from different sites on any site
 with enabled Solr module.

 Solr host name ...: 127.0.0.1
 Solr port ........: 8080
 Solr path ........: solr/unique001
 Solr path ........: solr/unique002
 Solr path ........: solr/unique003
 Solr path ........: solr/unique004
 Solr path ........: solr/unique005
 Solr path ........: solr/unique006
 Solr path ........: solr/unique007
 Solr path ........: solr/unique008

 To add more cores, you need to:

 1. Create a copy of example core directory:
    cp -ar /opt/solr/site_008 /opt/solr/site_009

 2. Add new core in file:
    /opt/solr/solr.xml

 3. Restart Tomcat:
    service tomcat restart

 You can also rename all cores in the file:
   /opt/solr/solr.xml
 to avoid using them by not authorized site owners:

   <cores adminPath="/admin/cores">
     <core name="unique001" instanceDir="site_001" />
     <core name="w44337377" instanceDir="site_002" />
     <core name="437y73347" instanceDir="site_003" />
     <core name="57245i854" instanceDir="site_004" />
     <core name="325o45758" instanceDir="site_005" />
     <core name="343q36454" instanceDir="site_006" />
     <core name="4574a6866" instanceDir="site_007" />
     <core name="32x463677" instanceDir="site_008" />
   </cores>


 To disable Apache Solr Search completely, type as root:

 $ service tomcat stop
 $ update-rc.d -f tomcat remove
 $ mv /etc/init.d/tomcat /etc/init.d/offtomcat
