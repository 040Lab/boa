# Also worth to note
----------------------------------------

Note:
  Your Aegir control panel is using self-signed SSL certificate,
  so you browser can display warning. Please add this certificate
  as accepted in your system settings to avoid displaying it
  each time you are trying to log in.


----------------------------------------
# FTP and SSH access
----------------------------------------

Your FTP/SSH username and password didn't change (unless you
changed it already).

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTP access.

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn (initial)

We recommend using SSH keys instead of password.

It is highly recommended you use only SSL/TLS connections for FTPS.
Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.


----------------------------------------
# Useful hints
----------------------------------------

* Run verify task on every site and platform after modules updates.
* Chmod -R 775 all modules and themes when uploaded via SSH or Drush.
* Chmod -R 777 all files uploaded to the sites/domain/files.
* Run verify task on site and its platform before running clone.
* Run verify task on site and both platforms before running migrate.
* Use migrate task to rename the site (domain).
* If any task is running longer than 10 minutes, contact us.
* If any task fails, send us the task log for debugging.
* Rename the site twice after import to get files paths rewritten.
