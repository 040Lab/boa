Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version 1.0-boa-T.

Also your system services, kernel and libraries have been upgraded.                         

Your Aegir control panel is available as before at:

 https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz


!! Please read this e-mail in its entirety. It contains
!! important, *updated* information required to properly leverage
!! all your available Aegir features.


----------------------------------------
# What is new or updated this time
----------------------------------------

* Speed Booster for 5.x, 6.x and 7.x Drupal platforms.
  This new feature adds super fast caching for anonymous visitors,
  and yes! - also for logged in users (cache per user) directly on
  the web server level - no Drupal module required.
  It works for all platforms, except of Ubercart, Commerce
  and any platform with ubercart in sites/all/modules/ubercart.

* Import your sites in 8 easy steps recipe - see further below.

* New platforms [supported only in Aegir Classic and TG version]:

  OpenPublic 7.0-beta1 --------- http://openpublicapp.com
  Drupal Commerce 7.0-dev ------ http://drupalcommerce.org
  NodeStream ------------------- http://nodestream.org
  Drupal Commons 1.4 ----------- http://acquia.com/drupalcommons
  OpenScholar 2.0-beta10 ------- http://openscholar.harvard.edu
  ProsePoint 0.37 -------------- http://prosepoint.org
  Acquia 7.0 ------------------- http://bit.ly/acquiadrupal

  Q: How to upgrade from Aegir Mini to Classic?
  
  A: Place a new order at http://omega8.cc/hosted-aegir
     and your old subscription will be cancelled
     plus any unused amount refunded the same day.

  Q: How to upgrade from Aegir Mini or Classic to Aegir TG?
  
  A: Aegir TG is a special, very high performance option,
     hosted on the high-end hardware in a separate custom
     cloud, so simple upgrade is not possible. Separate
     subscription and site migration will be required.

* Open Atrium 1.0-beta10 now includes new Ideation feature.
* Nginx server upgraded to version Barracuda/0.9.5
* PHP-FPM server upgraded to version 5.2.17
* MariaDB server configuration improved.
* Memcache extension replaced with memcached and libmemcached.
* Drush upgraded to version 4.4
* Drush Make upgraded to version 2.2
* Redis cache server upgraded to version 2.0.5


----------------------------------------
# What will be next
----------------------------------------

* Automated FTP accounts per site and per platform.
* Embedded Aegir Knowledge Base and How-To Recipes.
* ...and more.


----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
# Also worth to note
----------------------------------------

To realize the full speed from our servers, you simply need
to enable the module *cache* (it's like cacherouter, but
with chained cache - memcache/redis/db with auto-failover)
for every site you wish to accelerate. This module will
accelerate the site only for logged in users.

We also highly recommend to enable the *Boost* and *DB Tuner*
modules. After enabling *DB Tuner* please add all standard and
extra indexes recommended by the module.

The *Boost* module will accelerate your site for anonymous
visitors, while *DB Tuner* will do that both for anonymous
and logged in users.

All three modules are by default available for all 6.x
platforms only.

There are also two extra Pressflow core modules we recommend
to enable: *Path alias cache* and *Cookie cache bypass*.

When creating a development version of your site, you'll
want to work with our optimized caching systems turned off.

There is a speed-auto-switch available for dev/prod environments.
Any site you create/access with *dev* in the subdomain, will have
all caching and css/js aggregation disabled automatically,
while all PHP errors and notices enabled for easier debugging of
issues, including those causing WSOD.

You don't need to rename the site to be able to work on it
in the "dev" mode. Simply add a *dev* domain alias and
use it to access the site when you wish to skip all hardcoded
caching used on the non-dev domain.

Your Aegir control panel is using self-signed SSL certificate,
so you browser can display warning. Please add this certificate
as accepted in your system settings to avoid displaying it
each time you are trying to log in.


----------------------------------------
# FTP and SSH access
----------------------------------------

Your FTP/SSH username and password didn't change (unless you
changed it already).

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTP access.

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn (initial)

We recommend using SSH keys instead of password.

It is highly recommended you use only SSL/TLS connections for FTPS.
Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.

# Import your sites in 8 easy steps
----------------------------------------

Hint: Replace USER with your Aegir Octopus system (not ftp) username.
      Your Aegir system username is the same as your ftp username,
      minus .ftp.

1. Upload or rsync full drupal root of your site to static/custom/name

2. Chmod everything with: chmod -R 775 static/custom/name
   Chmod files with: chmod -R 777 static/custom/name/sites/default/files

3. Add platform in Aegir using full system path of static/custom/name
   so it will be (in this case) /data/disk/USER/static/custom/name

4. Create an empty site in the new platform with temporary subdomain
   like custom-name.your-domain.com

5. Move all files from sites/default/files to sites/domain/files
   with: cp -af sites/default/files/* sites/domain/files/

6. Import your uploaded database (or use backup_migrate module) with:
   cd static/custom/name/sites/domain
   drush sql-connect < /data/disk/USER/static/domain.sql
   drush cc (choose 1 to clear all)

7. Rename the site (using Migrate task) to your final domain.

8. Finally, re-verify the site in Aegir. Done!


----------------------------------------
# Always useful hints
----------------------------------------

* Chmod -R 775 all modules and themes when uploaded via SSH or Drush.
* Chmod -R 777 all files uploaded to the sites/domain/files.
* Re-verify the site in Aegir after uploading your modules and themes.
* Run verify task on every site and platform after modules updates.
* Run verify task on site and its platform before running clone.
* Run verify task on site and both platforms before running migrate.
* Use migrate task to rename the site (domain).
* Your FTP/SSH access to platforms is limited to /sites directory.
* If any task is running longer than 10 minutes, contact us.
* If any task fails, send us the task log for debugging.
* To disable Speed Booster per platform, create an empty directory
  with the name "ubercart" (unless you have there the real ubercart
  module), with one empty README.txt file inside, so its path will be
  sites/all/modules/ubercart/README.txt
