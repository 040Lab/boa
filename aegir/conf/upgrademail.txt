Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.0.2

  https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

We have many good news and a special promotion (25% off) this time.

Please read below for details.

Some new features:

* New default platforms with new Drupal core versions include
  either enhanced Pressflow 6.24 +Extra or standard 7.12 core.

  NOTE: before you will try to upgrade any of your sites,
  please read our important how-to:

  Really, please read it to avoid some heavy headaches!

* You can choose between PHP-FPM 5.2.17 and 5.3.9 version.
  Just let us know via http://omega8.cc/support form
  that you wish to switch to 5.3.9, since 5.2.17 is still
  configured by default to support some older platforms
  not fully compatible with PHP 5.3.9, but not everyone still
  needs to support 5.x or some old 6.x modules, so now you have
  a choice and you can use latest technology, if you wish.

* Both Speed Booster, Boost and Redis/Memcached supports separate
  caches per mobile device, so it is safe to use separate themes
  or content for mobile devices. We use simple logic to determine
  the kind of device and there are separate cache bins for
  mobile-tablet, mobile-smart and mobile-other.
  You can review it here: http://bit.ly/xzFfzK

* Purge module is now enabled by default in all 6.x and 7.x sites.
  Now Speed Booster works like a Boost - it expires immediately
  the cache for any node/page after it has been edited, comment
  has been added etc. It also automatically expires the cache
  for the homepage and RSS feed. You no longer need to wait
  up to one hour for Speed Booster cache expiration.
  Plus, unlike in Boost, it purges all separate caches for all
  mobile devices along with non-mobile cache, at once.
  Now you have a good reason to disable Boost and use our
  crazy fast Speed Booster only.

* You can use GeoIP data provided by your Nginx server
  in your custom code or modules with variables:
  $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE'] and $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_NAME']
  to display content or block depending on the visitor's country.
  You can check/review it from your location also on command line
  with: 'curl -I http://your-domain' - you will see GeoIP headers.

* You can safely manage Clients/Users attached to hosted sites
  in your Aegir interface. Make sure that all sites have its
  associated Client! Otherwise this site will be available
  for all Clients/Users you have added. The site can lost its
  association with Client after Clone task if there is any
  non-alphanumeric value in the Client name, like &.

* CloudFlare specific header 'CF-Connecting-IP' is now supported
  out of the box and available as standard $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
  in all 5.x, 6.x and 7.x platforms without any contrib module.

* You can disable both Boost and Speed Booster on the fly
  by adding ?nocache=1 to any URL. Useful for debugging.
