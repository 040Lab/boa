# Also worth to note
----------------------------------------

Your Aegir control panel is using self-signed SSL certificate, so you browser
can display warning. Please add this certificate as accepted in your system settings
to avoid displaying it each time you are trying to log in.


----------------------------------------
# FTP and SSH access
----------------------------------------

Your FTP/SSH username didn't change, but password has been reset.

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTP access.

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn

We recommend using SSH keys instead of password.

It is highly recommended you use only SSL/TLS connections for FTPS.
Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.
