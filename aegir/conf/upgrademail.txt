Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.4.4

  https://aegir.url.name

This BOA release includes several important system upgrades and
bug fixes. All supported Aegir platforms have been updated with
latest Drupal cores.

IMPORTANT!

This version automatically switches all hosted sites to PHP 5.5
on systems hosted and managed remotely by Omega8.cc support team,
unless you have explicitly switched your Octopus instance to use
PHP version you prefer. Using PHP older than 5.5 is strongly
discouraged, for security, stability and performance reasons.

We recommend that you upgrade your sites using this safe workflow:

You can find all details on how to use new features, along with all
other changes explained in the release notes and changelog available at:

  https://omega8.cc/boa-243-full-edition-360

It is always highly recommended that you read extensive release notes
and changelog posted on our website for previous BOA Editions, so you
could keep track on the progress and learn more about great features
and improvements we have made over the last few years, no matter when
you have started using Aegir powered by BOA:
