Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version boa.version

  https://aegir.url.name

This BOA release includes complete Aegir 3 with Drush 8, and introduces
full support for latest Drupal 8.0.5 and Drupal 8.1.0-beta2 as custom
platforms you can create in the ~/static directory tree.

@=> BOA will not include built-in Drupal 8 platforms until Drupal 8 will
    support symlinks in the codebase, like all previous core versions.

@=> All supported Aegir platforms have been updated to their latest releases

@=> Octopus Aegir instances hosted on Power Engine option will *not* receive
    upgrade to BOA-3.x unless requested via https://omega8.cc/support
    to prevent issues with (often) customized Hostmaster modules not ready
    for Drupal 7 based Aegir control panel. All hosted BOA systems will still
    continue to receive the Barracuda system upgrades.

@=> It is possible to host previous stable BOA-2.4.9 Octopus instances
    on systems with Barracuda upgraded to BOA-3.0.0
