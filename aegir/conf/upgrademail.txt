Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version boa.version

  https://aegir.url.name

This BOA release includes several important system upgrades, improvements
and bug fixes. All supported platforms have been updated to latest versions.

@=> Latest Drupal 7 core version used in BOA in all built-in platforms is
    compatible with latest PHP 7.0.6 -- you can switch your Octopus instance
    easily via fpm.info control file: https://omega8.cc/node/330 but please
    don't use 7.0 in cli.info, because it is not supported in the Aegir
    backend yet. PHP 7.0 can't be used if you have any Pressflow 6 site.

We recommend that you upgrade your sites using this safe workflow:

You can find all details on how to use new features, along with all
other changes explained in the release notes and changelog available at:

  https://omega8.cc/boa-302-full-edition-379

It is always highly recommended that you read extensive release notes
and changelog posted on our website for previous BOA Editions, so you
could keep track on the progress and learn more about great features
and improvements we have made over the last few years, no matter when
you have started using Aegir powered by BOA:
