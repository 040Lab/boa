Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.0.4

  https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz


=== GREAT NEWS ABOUT OUR AEGIR HOSTED SERVICE

* As you probably know already from our online announcements,
  we have introduced some amazing new feature, which allows us
  to host all your sites on the fastest possible hardware setup,
  while providing much more disk space than before.

  Your sites are powered by Hybrid Storage, which is transparently
  built from SSD and SAS drives. You have got it a few months
  before some well known company introduced its "Fusion Drive"
  powered iMachines ;)

  Here is how it works in our setup. The operating system powering
  your Aegir instance runs on the SSD (Solid-State Drive) exclusively.
  Also all daemons and all their related files, caches and logs
  are running/are stored on the SSD space.

  This makes your databases and also Speed Booster caching really,
  really fast. But there is more: also all built-in Drupal platforms
  files live on the super-fast SSD space - which is yet another
  reason to use them instead of custom platforms, if possible.

  Only the files you will upload or your sites will create, plus
  all databases and files backups created by BOA system or Aegir
  tasks will use SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) drives space, glued
  with your SSD space transparently behind the scenes.

  This setup allows us to maximize the speed of your sites, but also
  to offer much more space for your files - both static files, like
  images, and your custom code you will upload to extend built-in
  platforms and to create your custom platforms.

  You could think that the PHP code stored on SAS space is slower
  than that stored on SSD, and it is, but only on the first read,
  since later it is stored/read from RAM memory anyway, optimized
  with APC, so effectively it almost always offers the same speed.

  This advanced technology is currently used in all our locations:
  California, Texas, New York, Netherlands and Singapore, and all
  existing Aegir instances we host are powered by the same magic,
  developed to make your sites faster than the blink of an eye.


=== IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

* All newer Aegir instances with only PHP 5.3 version installed,
  received also PHP 5.2.17 version, ready to use for Drupal 6 based
  sites, especially when you still use modules which are not fully
  compatible with PHP 5.3 - please read below for more details.

  We are changing also default PHP-FPM version used by all D6 sites
  to the old PHP-FPM 5.2.17, but we can set it to latest 5.3.18,
  on request submitted via: http://omega8.cc/support

  NOTE: Only Aegir instances we host or manage remotely are
        affected by this change, while self-hosted instances
        are not automatically re-configured. Note also that
        this change is effective only for newer instances,
        since it was a default setup on older instances anyway.

* At the same time we are changing the default Aegir PHP-CLI backend
  to the latest 5.3.18 version from previous default 5.2.17

  This step is required before we will introduce newest Drush 5
  as a default version on all servers (we still use our modified
  4.6 version, which supports also Drupal 8), since Drush 5
  requires PHP 5.3 or newer.

  NOTE: Only Aegir instances we host or manage remotely are
        affected by this change, while self-hosted instances
        are not automatically re-configured.

  If you didn't know, the old instances used PHP-CLI 5.2 in the
  backend for all Drupal versions, while forcing PHP-FPM 5.2.17
  for all D5 and D6 based sites and PHP-FPM 5.3 for all D7 sites
  and the Aegir control panel, which is still D6 based, but running
  already on a modern PHP-FPM 5.3 frontend.

  Now any Drupal 5 based site you host will still use
  its only compatible 5.2.17 PHP-FPM version for web access,
  but you will not be able to run any Aegir tasks on them.

  Yes, we are about to drop Drupal 5 support in the near future.

  If you still need the support for Drupal 5 in the Aegir backend,
  please submit a support request via http://omega8.cc/support,
  but please be aware that reverting your backend to PHP-CLI 5.2.17
  will break support for some newer distros, which use modules
  depending on PHP 5.3 or newer.

  NOTE: You may wonder why we are changing Aegir backend to
        PHP-CLI 5.3, while changing frontend version for D6 sites
        to PHP-FPM 5.2 on instances already using 5.3 - The reason
        is simple: 5.2 is still more safe to use with Drupal 6
        and we want all instances to use the same setup before
        we will introduce next changes in the near future, to make
        this process consistent and avoid breaking any D6 based
        sites, just in case some of them still use code not yet
        compatible with PHP-FPM 5.3, and at the same time, by
        using PHP-CLI 5.3 in the backend, we are providing you
        a safer method to reveal possible issues without affecting
        your visitors, to help you make your D6 sites fully
        compatible with newer PHP 5.3 version.

* We plan to shorten BOA system release and upgrades cycle
  to 1-2 months max, so we have decided to remove support for some
  outdated distros. We have tried to manage both security and version
  updates for some abandoned or semi-abandoned distros, to keep them
  useful for you, but since it involves increasing amount of work
  because of cascades of no longer compatible patches and various
  dependencies, we have decided that it is time to stop doing it,
  if their original maintainers no longer care about their users.

  Here is a list of distros we no longer support:

  MartPlug ------------ http://drupal.org/project/martplug
  Octopus Video ------- http://octopusvideo.org
  Open Academy -------- http://drupal.org/project/openacademy
  Open Enterprise ----- http://drupal.org/project/openenterprise
  OpenPublic ---------- http://openpublicapp.com
  Videola ------------- http://videola.tv

  The platforms listed above can be re-added when their maintainers
  will fix all critical issues and/or apply required updates.
