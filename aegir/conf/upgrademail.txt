Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version boa.version

  https://aegir.url.name

This BOA release includes several important system upgrades and bug fixes,
with most notable features and changes listed below.

@=> All supported Aegir platforms have been updated with latest Drupal cores

@=> Drupal 8 support for custom platforms in the ~/static directory tree
    will be included, along with Drush 8 and PHP 7 in the *upcoming*
    BOA-3.0.0 release: https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/milestones/3.0.0

@=> This BOA release (2.4.7) is the last release which still supports
    deprecated PHP versions: 5.3 and 5.4 -- You should switch to PHP 5.6
    or at least 5.5 as soon as possible, or you will not be able to upgrade
    to newer BOA versions after 2.4.7 -- https://omega8.cc/node/330

@=> What are BOA plans for Drupal 6 support after February 24th, 2016?
    We will support Drupal/Pressflow 6 in all new releases, as long as
    available PHP versions will allow to use it (we run our own Pressflow 6
    based site on PHP 5.6 for many months with zero issues). For more details
    please check: https://github.com/omega8cc/boa/issues/824

@=> BOA switched from SPDY to HTTP/2 + PFS on all supported OS versions
