#2 BACKUPS ROTATION
----------------------------------------

We encourage you to review our backups rotation policy. It is the same
for years but in case you are not aware it even exists, it is a good idea
to learn how the available disk space for files should be used properly:

#3 NEW DATACENTERS
----------------------------------------

Also in May, we are adding Chicago, Illinois, to our ever growing list
of available datacenters locations, with Tokyo, Japan and Ashburn, Virginia,
following later this summer. There will be also next generation, newer
locations added in San Jose, California and Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

----------------------------------------
#4 AEGIR EXPEDITION
----------------------------------------

New Aegir Expedition option will be introduced once the first new locations
are available. It will allow you to request per-site migrations between
all our locations, so you will be able to easily and gracefully relocate
some or all of sites hosted to provide even better experience and faster
access to your sites target audience, with per-site precision, and without
the need to multiply your subscriptions. This should open entirely new
world of unique opportunities, cost-savings and efficiency, and any existing
option will be able to receive upgrade to Aegir Expedition, very easily.


We are very excited to be able to introduce new options and services,
thanks to innovations possible in all five new datacenters worldwide.

Stay tuned for more news!
