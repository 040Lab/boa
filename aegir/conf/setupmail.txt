Hello,

Welcome to your new Aegir control panel

1. Logging into your Aegir control panel
2. Deploying Aegir default web sites
3. Setting up search with Solr
4. Adding modules & themes
5. Advanced user information


Please read this e-mail in its entirety. It contains
important information required to properly leverage
all your available Aegir features.


----------------------------------------
#1 LOGGING INTO YOUR AEGIR CONTROL PANEL
----------------------------------------

To gain access, please visit your control panel site
using one-time login link you should receive shortly
in a separate e-mail.

Once in your control panel, you'll find (*) a number of
Drupal distributions ready to deploy:
 
 Atrium 1.0-beta8 ------------- http://openatrium.com
 Managing News 1.2 ------------ http://managingnews.com
 Drupal Commons 1.1 ----------- http://acquia.com/drupalcommons
 Acquia 6.19-svn (int) -------- http://bit.ly/acquiadrupal
 OpenPublish 2.2.285 ---------- http://openpublishapp.com
 OpenScholar 2.0-b8-3.1 ------- http://openscholar.harvard.edu
 ProsePoint 0.36 (int) -------- http://prosepoint.org
 Ubercart (int) --------------- http://ubercart.org
 Drupal 5.23 Pressflow -------- http://pressflow.org
 Drupal 6.19 Pressflow (int) -- http://pressflow.org
 Drupal 6.19 Cocomore --------- http://drupal.cocomore.com
 Drupal 7.0-rc1 --------------- http://drupal.org/project/drupal
 Feature Server --------------- http://bit.ly/fserver
                                http://bit.ly/fservermore

(*) Some platforms are not available in all options.
    Drupal Commons, OpenPublish and OpenScholar are
    not available in Aegir MINI, while Aegir NANO
    includes only Acquia platform. Consider upgrade
    to the Aegir CLASSIC to get the access to all our
    standard platforms.

All 5/6 platforms have been enhanced using Pressflow Drupal core.
More details about Pressflow Drupal are here:

 http://pressflow.org

Platforms marked with (int) comes also with ready to use translations
of Drupal core in 22 languages. Only languages with at least 10 maintainers
and at least 60% of progress are included - http://localize.drupal.org

Other platforms are using extended and customized translations or
require far more than just core translation, so they are not modified.

Every Open Atrium platform comes with a ready-to-use bonus
feature - Atrium Reader - a mini version of Managing News.
You can see it in action here: http://bit.ly/atriumreader

Another great Open Atrium feature is the default
Apache Solr Search integration. You can use it with any
remotely hosted Solr service, including our own hosted
version - learn more here:

----------------------------------------
#2. DEPLOYING YOUR WEB SITES
----------------------------------------

The best way to get started is simply to log into the
control panel and start testing how Aegir works. We're
always ready to assist and guide you step by step, so please
don't hesitate to ask questions - we would love to help you!

Creating a new site is as easy as clicking the Add Site tab.

To make a site "live" using any domain name you manage, you
need to point its A or CNAME DNS record to your VPS address,
like below:

 yourdomain.com.           IN  A      166.84.6.231
  or
 subdomain.yourdomain.com. IN  CNAME  aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

You can also use any subdomain in *.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz to create
test sites, for example: http://atrium.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz etc.


----------------------------------------
#3. SETTING UP SEARCH WITH SOLR
----------------------------------------

One Apache Solr Core is available free with every hosted
Aegir server, when paid yearly.

Contact our support department to associate the Solr search
with your desired site.


----------------------------------------
#4. ADDING MODULES & THEMES
----------------------------------------

To add modules/themes to any of the enabled platforms,
you need to log into your FTPS/SSH account:

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn

It is highly recommended you use only SSL/TLS connections for FTPS.
Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.


----------------------------------------
#5. ADVANCED USER INFORMATION
----------------------------------------


=== IMPORTANT DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Your home directory shows a number of subdirectories, each
one for a different platforms release, while each platform can
include modules/themes in a separate, standard multisite
directory tree.


=== IMPORTANT CUSTOM PLATFORM INFORMATION

When logged in via FTPS or SSH you'll find a subdirectory
named 'static'. This is the place to upload your optional
custom Drupal platform, each in a separate directory,
named in the form:

 /static/platforms/my-green-platform
 /static/platforms/another-custom-platform

When you want to enable any of those custom platforms, just use
the built-in "Add platform" option in your Aegir control panel.

Please remember to use full system paths. You can check the path
with "pwd" command when logged in via SSH.

Note that we allow only Pressflow core based platforms for
5.x and 6.x Drupal versions.

You can also upload a tar.gz/zip archive with your existing site
(including database dump) and we will create your custom
platform in Aegir and import your site. You will be able
to clone your custom site with a working address in the form of:

 http://anyname.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

in order to test everything before changing your DNS to the
new A or CNAME address.

PLEASE NOTE: Having a custom platform created from an
imported/uploaded site is an add-on service, paid separately or
free-of-charge with a yearly (hosted) subscription. Please
find more details on our website:

 http://omega8.cc/site-import
 http://omega8.cc/hosted-aegir


=== IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT SITE INFORMATION

When creating a development version of your site, you'll
want to work with our optimized caching systems turned off.

There is a speed-auto-switch available for dev/prod environments.
Any site you create/access with *dev* in the subdomain, will have
all caching and css/js aggregation disabled automatically,
while all PHP errors (including critical wsod) enabled.

You don't need to rename the site to be able to work on it
in the "dev" mode. Simply add a *dev* domain alias and
use it to access the site when you wish to skip all hardcoded
caching used on the non-dev domain.


=== IMPORTANT CACHING INFORMATION

To realize the full speed from our servers, you simply need
to enable the module *cache* (it's like cacherouter, but
with chained cache - memcache/redis/db with auto-failover)
for every site you wish to accelerate.


=== USEFUL HINTS

* Run verify task on every site and platform after modules updates.
* Chmod -R 775 all modules and themes when uploaded via SSH or Drush.
* Chmod -R 777 all files uploaded to the sites/domain/files.
* Run verify task on site and its platform before running clone.
* Run verify task on site and both platforms before running migrate.
* Use migrate task to rename the site (domain).
* If any task is running longer than 10 minutes, contact us.
* If any task fails, send us the task log for debugging.
* Rename the site twice after import to get files paths rewritten.
