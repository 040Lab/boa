### IMPORTANT!

* Don't run any installer via sudo.
  You must be logged in as root or `sudo -i` first.

* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!
