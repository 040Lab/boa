Your Debian or Ubuntu system uses SHA512 for passwords encryption by default.

This is not bad, and for sure much better than MD5 by default used by BOA for
all newly created SSH/FTPS accounts (both main and extra - for Aegir Clients).

But since BOA forces all users to update their passwords every 90 days, once
the user updates his password, it is automatically encrypted with SHA512.

You can easily switch your system to use much more secure Bcrypt/Blowfish,
using the simple steps listed below:

1. Make sure you have working SSH keys for your root account.
2. Make sure you have working SSH keys for your root account.
3. Make sure you have working SSH keys for your root account.

REALLY. Don't even read anything below, if you didn't set this up yet!
        You could lock yourself out of your server forever (almost),
        if your only access is password based and something will go wrong,
        for whatever reason.

OK, next steps:

$ apt-get install libpam-unix2 -y

$ cp /usr/share/pam-configs/unix /usr/share/pam-configs/unix2
$ sed -i "s/^Name: Unix/Name: Unix2/g"  /usr/share/pam-configs/unix2
$ sed -i "s/pam_unix.so/pam_unix2.so/g" /usr/share/pam-configs/unix2
$ sed -i "s/nullok_secure//g"           /usr/share/pam-configs/unix2
$ sed -i "s/obscure//g"                 /usr/share/pam-configs/unix2
$ sed -i "s/sha512//g"                  /usr/share/pam-configs/unix2
$ sed -i "s/rounds//g"                  /usr/share/pam-configs/unix2
$ sed -i "s/pam_unix.so/pam_unix2.so/g" /etc/pam.d/pure-ftpd
$ sed -i "s/^CRYPT=des.*/CRYPT=blowfish/g" /etc/security/pam_unix2.default
$ sed -i "s/^BLOWFISH_CRYPT_FILES=.*/BLOWFISH_CRYPT_FILES=8/g" /etc/security/pam_unix2.default

$ pam-auth-update

  [*] Unix2 authentication
  [ ] Unix authentication

Make sure to *enable* "Unix2 authentication" and disable "Unix authentication"
using Arrow keys, then choose <Ok> with Tab and hit Enter to confirm.

Now update your root password and any other account password for testing.

You will notice in the /etc/shadow file that instead of lines similar to:

== It is $1$ MD5 ==
o1.ftp:$1$XVn3/oPw$Me6EZMC2A4/qAayQGRCh2/:15801::90:7:::

== It is $6$ SHA512 ==
o1.ftp:$6$N52KMMFm$m/CB/sQtgREx1TtlHNy7aBHUxUQMx6r3q8O39FDTbt6Etzfi2ZYqR/AjUWtRWHmz3IPjZQW8xtXJjwbee9dFk0:15822::90:7:::

Now it looks similar to:

== It is $2a$ $08$ Bcrypt/Blowfish ==
o1.ftp:$2a$08$EeO3oNMsWxqtvCdWrZfeNeQhwxI0MxqJEDjvRqjZ1Cvc5Yu8XbTlK:15822::90:7:::

Test if the updated password for o1.ftp allows you to log in via SSH and FTPS.

Done!
