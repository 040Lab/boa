Note about platforms naming convention:

  Basic Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 platforms  come in three instances,
  to make your standard workflow easier for: -dev, -stage and -prod,
  with correct suffix: D.00x, S.00x and P.00x in the platform name.
  There is no difference between D/S/P, besides the name.

  Q: How to upgrade/add more Cores?

  A: To add more Standard Cores, use the order form at:
     http://omega8.cc/buy#standard. To add more SSD Cores,
     use the order form at http://omega8.cc/buy#ssd

  Q: How to upgrade from Aegir Mini or Classic to Aegir SSD?

  A: Aegir SSD is a special, very high performance option,
     hosted on the high-end hardware in a separate custom
     cloud, so simple upgrade is not possible. Separate
     subscription and site migration will be required.

All 6.x platforms have been enhanced using Pressflow Drupal core.
More details about Pressflow Drupal are here:

 http://pressflow.org

Hosted Open Atrium 1.3.1 includes extra features:

 Atrium Folders:  http://bit.ly/oafolders
 Ideation:        http://bit.ly/oaideation


----------------------------------------
#2. DEPLOYING YOUR WEB SITES
----------------------------------------

The best way to get started is simply to log into the
control panel and start testing how Aegir works. We're
always ready to assist and guide you step by step, so please
don't hesitate to ask questions - we would love to help you!

Creating a new site is as easy as clicking the Add Site tab.

To make a site "live" using any domain name you manage, you
need to point its A or CNAME DNS record to your VPS address,
like below:

 yourdomain.com.           IN  A      166.84.6.231
  or
 subdomain.yourdomain.com. IN  CNAME  aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz.

You can also use any subdomain in *.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz to create
test sites, for example: http://atrium.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz etc.


----------------------------------------
#3. SETTING UP SEARCH WITH SOLR
----------------------------------------

One Apache Solr Core is available free with 4+ Aegir Hosted Cores,
when paid yearly.

Contact our support department to associate the Solr search
with your desired site.


----------------------------------------
#4. ADDING MODULES & THEMES
----------------------------------------

To add modules/themes to any of the enabled platforms,
you need to log into your FTPS/SSH/SFTP account:

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTPS access.

We recommend using SSH keys instead of password.

Note that while your Aegir instance comes with FTPS/SSH/SFTP access,
there is no plain FTP access available.

Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.

You can manage your databases via Chive Manager web interface,
using access credentials (dbhost, dbname and dbpass) available
in every site settings.php file.

Chive Manager URL: https://166.84.6.231


----------------------------------------
#5. ADVANCED USER INFORMATION
----------------------------------------


=== IMPORTANT DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Your home directory shows a number of subdirectories, each
one for a different platforms release, while each platform can
include modules/themes in a separate, standard multisite
directory tree.


=== IMPORTANT CUSTOM PLATFORM INFORMATION

When logged in via FTPS or SSH you'll find a subdirectory
named 'static'. This is the place to upload your optional
custom Drupal platform, each in a separate directory,
named in the form:

 /static/platforms/my-green-platform
 /static/platforms/another-custom-platform

When you want to enable any of those custom platforms, just use
the built-in "Add platform" option in your Aegir control panel.

Please remember to use full system paths. You can check the path
with "pwd" command when logged in via SSH.

Note that we allow only Pressflow core based platforms for
5.x and 6.x Drupal versions.

You can also upload a tar.gz/zip archive with your existing site
(including database dump) and we will create your custom
platform in Aegir and import your site. You will be able
to clone your custom site with a working address in the form of:

 http://anyname.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz

in order to test everything before changing your DNS to the
new A or CNAME address.

PLEASE NOTE: Having a custom platform created from an
imported/uploaded site is an add-on service, paid separately or
free-of-charge with a yearly (hosted) subscription. Please
find more details on our website:

#6. NEW FEATURES IN BOA-2.0.2
----------------------------------------

* All new 7.x sites now run on latest PHP-FPM 5.3.10 by default.
  For existing sites it is enough to re-verify them in your
  Aegir control panel to get them on PHP-FPM 5.3.10 automatically.

  All existing and new 5.x sites run on the old PHP-FPM 5.2.17
  version by default and you can't change that.

  You can still choose between PHP-FPM 5.2.17 and 5.3.10 for
  all your 6.x sites - just let us know via http://omega8.cc/support
  that you wish to switch to 5.3.10 - but make sure first that all
  your 6.x sites are fully PHP 5.3 compatible. By default all
  6.x sites still run on PHP-FPM 5.2.17.

* New default platforms with new Drupal core versions include
  either enhanced Pressflow 6.25.1 +Extra or standard 7.12 core.

  NOTE: before you will try to upgrade any of your sites,
  please read our important how-to:

  http://omega8.cc/the-best-recipes-for-disaster-139
  http://omega8.cc/are-there-any-specific-good-habits-to-learn-116
  http://omega8.cc/managing-your-code-in-the-aegir-style-110

  Really, please read it to avoid some heavy headaches!

  Please note that instead of waiting for 6.25, we already
  included patches required to fix major issues with 6.24:

  http://drupal.org/node/1425868
  http://drupal.org/node/1425260

* Both Speed Booster, Boost and Redis/Memcached supports separate
  caches per mobile device, so it is safe to use separate themes
  or content for mobile devices. We use simple logic to determine
  the kind of device and there are separate cache bins for
  mobile-tablet, mobile-smart and mobile-other.
  You can review it here: http://bit.ly/wYz6PG

* Purge module is now enabled by default in all 6.x and also 7.x
  sites. Now Speed Booster works like a Boost - it expires
  immediately the cache for any node/page as soon as it has been
  edited or comment added. It also automatically expires the cache
  for the homepage and RSS feed at once. You no longer need to wait
  up to one hour for Speed Booster cache expiration. Plus, unlike
  in Boost, it purges all separate caches for all mobile devices
  along with non-mobile cache, at once. Now you have a good reason
  to disable Boost and use our crazy fast Speed Booster only.

* You can use GeoIP data provided by your Nginx server
  in your custom code or modules with variables:
  $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE'] and $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_NAME']
  to display content or block depending on the visitor's country.
  You can check/review it from your location also on command line
  with: 'curl -I http://your-domain' - you will see GeoIP headers.

* You can safely manage Clients/Users attached to hosted sites
  in your Aegir interface. Make sure that all sites have its
  associated Client! Otherwise the site will be listed as available
  for all Clients/Users you have added. The site can lost its
  association with Client after Clone task if there is any
  non-alphanumeric value in the Client name, like &.

* CloudFlare specific header 'CF-Connecting-IP' is now supported
  out of the box and available as standard $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
  in all 5.x, 6.x and 7.x platforms without any contrib module.

* You can disable both Boost and Speed Booster on the fly
  by adding ?nocache=1 to any URL. Useful for debugging.

* Speed Booster offers now also ESI microcaching, as explained
  in this article: http://groups.drupal.org/node/197478.
  This may enhance not only anonymous visitors, but also
  logged in users experience, since it allows you to separate
  microcache for ESI/SSI includes (valid for just 15 seconds)
  from both default Speed Booster cache for anonymous visitors
  (valid by default for 3 hours, unless purged on demand via
  recently introduced Purge/Expire modules) and also from
  Speed Booster cache per logged in user (valid for 60 seconds).
  The ESI module is included in all 6.x platforms but is not
  enabled and not configured automatically, so please consult
  its documentation for details on how to use it properly.

  Now you have three different levels of Speed Booster cache
  to leverage and deliver the 'live content' experience for
  all visitors, and still protect your server from DoS or
  simply high load caused by unexpected high traffic etc.
