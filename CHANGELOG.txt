### Stable Edition BOA-2.0.3
### Date: Thu May 17 18:17:40 EST 2012
### Installs Aegir 2.0.3 compatible with Aegir 1.9

# There are major improvements and new features added in this BOA Edition.

  Here is the description of those most important/expected, while complete
  list of all changes, new features and fixes is available further below.

  * Caching backend has been simplified. We no longer use chained cache
    system with Memcached+Redis+database. New system uses only Redis cache
    and the same configuration for all Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 platforms.
    This new system doesn't require any extra module to be enabled in any site.
    Complete integration is already enabled by default for every platform/site
    installed by default and for every custom platform as before - the next
    day after first site on the custom platform has been created.
    You can disable this caching layer using the same modules/cache/NO.txt
    control file as before. While there is just one cache engine (Redis) used,
    there is also an automatic, instant failover to standard database caching,
    just in case Redis is not available for some reason. You can also disable
    Redis cache on the fly for debugging by adding ?noredis=1 to any URL.
    
  * We have added support for Drupal 8.x while still using modified
    Drush 4.6-dev version, so we can still support Drupal 5 on the same
    system, but on another Octopus instance.
  
  * You can choose different PHP version for PHP-FPM (web access)
    and PHP-CLI, for even greater control over compatibility with
    various Drupal major versions.
    
  * You can choose both PHP-FPM and PHP-CLI versions per Octopus instance,
    on the same system. And you can change those versions on upgrade.

  * Installing and upgrading BOA system has been greatly simplified.
    You can still configure and run both installers as before,
    but you can also use these new, shockingly simple command line tools
    to install Barracuda and Octopus at once, to install more Octopus
    instances, to run selective or batch upgrades of all Octopus instances etc.
    See docs/INSTALL.txt and docs/UPGRADE.txt for details.

  * We have added an 'easy install' configuration shortcuts for both
    standard (public) and localhost installs. You no longer need
    to read, understand and configure all options, unless you prefer
    to choose some non-default configuration options.

  * Default installs on Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu Precise use
    packages for PHP 5.3, so initial setup takes just 10-15 minutes.

  * You can easily grant limited shell and FTPS access for developers,
    simply by creating "Clients" in the Aegir control panel and define
    them as 'owners' of one or more sites. Their access will be limited
    to only sites they can manage, but only if you will send them their
    access credentials, which are independent of their Aegir control
    panel credentials and stored in the ~/users/ directory in your main account.
    You will find there files with passwords for every "Client" with at least
    one site attached. For example ~/users/o1.username file means that
    this Client's username for SSH and FTPS access is 'o1.username' while
    his password is stored in this file. This means that SSH/FTPS access
    is not granted automatically, but you can decide who should receive it.
    How to change any extra user's password? Simply delete his ~/users/o1.username
    file and wait up to 5 minutes - the system will re-create his account
    with new password. And how to delete the user completely? Simply
    delete this user "Client" account in the Aegir control panel and allow
    the system to delete also his SSH/FTPS access in the next 5 minutes.

  * We have added segfault monitor for php-fpm and nginx, enabled by default.
    It is pretty aggressive, because it disables vhost of any site causing
    segfault errors and sends e-mail alert to the Octopus instance owner
    and server owner e-mail addresses. Simple site re-verify in Aegir enables
    the site again - but until the next segfault only, so read the info
    included in the e-mail alert message, if this will happen. If you prefer
    to not run this monitor: `rm -f /var/xdrago/monitor/check/segfault_alert`

  * Previously recommended site and platforms re-verify on Clone or Migrate
    is now fully automated. Aegir will run these extra tasks as a part
    of Clone or Migrate task, to make sure that there are no errors
    and that Aegir is using up-to-date information collected about
    platforms and sites. It also automatically fixes the known problem
    with domain aliases incorrectly written in the original and cloned sites,
    as reported in the Aegir queue: http://drupal.org/node/1004526
  
  * Apps are now fully supported. If the App is not downloaded yet, installing
    it via browser only requires write permissions, normally never available
    for the web server user, so you need to create an empty control file, either
    in sites/all/modules/apps-allow.info or sites/domain/modules/apps-allow.info
    and then run 'Reset password' task. It will open write access where required
    until the next site 'Verify' task will run . After installing the App,
    remember to re-Verify the site to restore default, safe permissions.

  * Custom local.settings.php file support uses similar logic with control file
    sites/domain/modules/local-allow.info and also 'Reset password' task.
    After running this task the local.settings.php file will be group writable,
    so you will be able to edit it also when logged in as limited shell user.
    Remember to run site Verify when done, to restore standard, safe permissions.
    Note that this file is created automatically, but is not open for write
    access by default.

### Stable Edition BOA-2.0.2
### Date: Thu Feb 9 14:00:00 EST 2012
### Installs Aegir 2.0.2

# Note on new and updated platforms and new Drupal core:

  All 6.x and 7.x platforms have been updated with latest core,
  so they are all in fact new in this BOA Edition, but we list here
  only really new platforms or those with new version released
  since last BOA Edition, with one exception: we list also basic
  6.24.1 and 7.12 platforms as new.

  Please note that instead of waiting for 6.25, we already
  included patches required to fix major issues with 6.24:

  http://drupal.org/node/1425868
  http://drupal.org/node/1425260

  Our Pressflow 6.24.1 +Extra version includes not only listed
  above patches, but also a few extra, performance related
  patches discussed here:

  http://groups.drupal.org/node/187209

  Note also that we renamed too basic Acquia 7.x platform to
  Ubercart 3.x platform. It is based on the same acquia install
  profile, but includes all contrib modules required for any
  basic Ubercart 3.x site.

  NOTE: before you will try to upgrade any of your sites,
  please read our important how-to:

# New features:

  * Barracuda now supports Debian Lenny to Squeeze major upgrade.
    Of course you should create full backup image before running
    this major system upgrade, just in case, but all the rest
    is fully automated - it is enough to set advanced configuration
    option in Barracuda to _LENNY_TO_SQUEEZE=YES and run Barracuda
    as usual. It will upgrade your system to Squeeze and re-build
    everything, with almost no downtime during the upgrade.
    You will still need to reboot the server when it will complete
    all upgrades.

    Important: Debian Lenny reached EOL on February 6, 2012.
    Details: http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/2012/msg00001.html

  * All new 7.x sites now run on latest PHP-FPM 5.3.10 by default.
    For existing sites it is enough to re-verify them in your
    Aegir control panel to get them on PHP-FPM 5.3.10 automatically.

    All existing and new 5.x sites run on the old PHP-FPM 5.2.17
    version by default and you can't change that.

    You can still choose between PHP-FPM 5.2.17 and 5.3.10 for
    all your 6.x sites - just let us know via http://omega8.cc/support
    that you wish to switch to 5.3.10 - but make sure first that all
    your 6.x sites are fully PHP 5.3 compatible. By default all
    6.x sites still run on PHP-FPM 5.2.17.

    Of course you could choose 5.3.10 for 6.x sites on one Octopus
    instance and 5.2.17 on another - on the same server. Just one more
    reason to use Octopus built-in intelligence :)

    All of this works the same both for Aegir Master Instance
    and all Aegir Satellite Instances.

  * Both Speed Booster, Boost and Redis/Memcached supports separate
    caches per mobile device, so it is safe to use separate themes
    or content for mobile devices. We use simple logic to determine
    the kind of device and there are separate cache bins for
    mobile-tablet, mobile-smart and mobile-other.
    You can review it here: http://bit.ly/wYz6PG

  * Purge module is now enabled by default in all 6.x and also 7.x
    sites. Now Speed Booster works like a Boost - it expires
    immediately the cache for any node/page as soon as it has been
    edited or comment added. It also automatically expires the cache
    for the homepage and RSS feed at once. You no longer need to wait
    up to one hour for Speed Booster cache expiration. Plus, unlike
    in Boost, it purges all separate caches for all mobile devices
    along with non-mobile cache, at once. Now you have a good reason
    to disable Boost and use our crazy fast Speed Booster only.

  * You can use GeoIP data provided by your Nginx server
    in your custom code or modules with variables:
    $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_CODE'] and $_SERVER['GEOIP_COUNTRY_NAME']
    to display content or block depending on the visitor's country.
    You can check/review it from your location also on command line
    with: 'curl -I http://your-domain' - you will see GeoIP headers.

  * You can safely manage Clients/Users attached to hosted sites
    in your Aegir interface. Make sure that all sites have its
    associated Client! Otherwise the site will be listed as available
    for all Clients/Users you have added. The site can lost its
    association with Client after Clone task if there is any
    non-alphanumeric value in the Client name, like &.

  * CloudFlare specific header 'CF-Connecting-IP' is now supported
    out of the box and available as standard $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
    in all 5.x, 6.x and 7.x platforms without any contrib module.

  * You can disable both Boost and Speed Booster on the fly
    by adding ?nocache=1 to any URL. Useful for debugging.

  * Speed Booster offers now also ESI microcaching, as explained
    in this article: http://groups.drupal.org/node/197478.
    This may enhance not only anonymous visitors, but also
    logged in users experience, since it allows you to separate
    microcache for ESI/SSI includes (valid for just 15 seconds)
    from both default Speed Booster cache for anonymous visitors
    (valid by default for 3 hours, unless purged on demand via
    recently introduced Purge/Expire modules) and also from
    Speed Booster cache per logged in user (valid for 60 seconds).
    The ESI module is included in all 6.x platforms but is not
    enabled and not configured automatically, so please consult
    its documentation for details on how to use it properly.

    Now you have three different levels of Speed Booster cache
    to leverage and deliver the 'live content' experience for
    all visitors, and still protect your server from DoS or
    simply high load caused by unexpected high traffic etc.

  * Automatic configuration of options required when Barracuda
    detects _VMFAMILY=AWS (Amazon EC2).

  * Both _NGINX_WORKERS and _PHP_FPM_WORKERS are now configurable.

  * You can avoid overwriting /etc/mysql/my.cnf with empty
    control file: $ touch /etc/mysql/custom.my.cnf

  * You can avoid overwriting /opt/etc/php.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /usr/local/lib/php.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /opt/local/etc/php53.ini on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /opt/etc/custom.php53.ini

  * You can avoid overwriting /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root on upgrade
    by adding your extra/custom entries in the extra file:
    $ nano /var/xdrago/cron/custom.txt

  * You can avoid overwriting your CSF configuration on upgrade
    with empty control file: $ touch /var/log/custom.csf.log

  * We no longer need to force MariaDB on Lenny and MariaDB Natty on Oneiric.
  * We no longer need to use Percona for Maverick on Natty and Oneiric.
  * We use _THIS_DB_HOST=localhost by default.

### Thu, 2010-09-23 17:30 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.B

Added/Fixed: (upgrade for all pre-A14.A required)

1.  Introducing default SSL Wildcard Nginx Proxy.
    Works for all sites/hostmaster instances on
    the same server and can be used also for
    encrypted connections to Chive and Collectd.
    Doesn't interfere even with SSL enabled sites
    on the same IP (with separate certs).

2.  The redirects are now back and enhanced.
    Fully compatible with Nginx in any combination
    with aliases and SSL settings/modes.

3.  Barracuda and Octopus by default installs still
    Aegir HEAD, but the latest alpha14 also works.

4.  Octopus can define its separate IP address
    if available.

5.  Fixed issue with too aggresive Hot Sauce check,
    causing creating not shared copies of code
    for platforms on every install or upgrade.

6.  Barracuda and Octopus now allows to skip DNS
    test, to make it possible to install on any
    virtualbox with dynamic DNS/IP etc. There is
    no guarantee it will work, but another switch
    is now available, if someone needs it.

7.  Octopus can now turn off local Memcache and Redis
    caches and switch all sites to use defined remote
    caches.

8.  Forced /etc/apt/sources.list rewrite also before
    the Barracuda system upgrade.

9.  Fix for the already installed and possibly broken
    git-core.

10. Fix for Aegir sites with .info domains, the path
    alias should now work without 403 error.


### Fri, 2010-09-17 11:00 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A14.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade required)

1. Barracuda and Octopus by default installs now
   Aegir HEAD to use the fix for critical issue

### Tue, 2010-09-12 21:50 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A13.A

Added/Fixed: (upgrade recommended)

1.  Octopus now creates SSH/FTPS separate, non-aegir
    account for every Aegir Satellite Instance,
    with limited shell to avoid using commands
    like "drush up" since they should never be used
    on sites managed in the Aegir system.

2.  Octopus now by default sends a welcome e-mail
    with some useful intro information and access
    details to the address defined as _CLIENT_EMAIL.

3.  When Octopus is used the first time to create
    an Aegir Satellite Instance, it doesn't allow
    to skip installing all platforms, since it is
    recommended to add all available platforms with
    initial install, for easier re-using the code
    by next Aegir Satellite Instances.

4.  The second and all future non-core Hostmaster
    installs allow to choose one or more platforms
    or to skip adding platforms at all.

5.  Octopus by default honors initial domain used
    for the Aegir Satellite Instance on every
    upgrade to avoid mistakes with using different
    copies of the script for different Aegir
    Satellite Instances upgrades.

6.  Also Barracuda will always honor initial
    domain used for the core Hostmaster to avoid
    mistakes on upgrade when you don't use
    the original version of the script.

7.  Better checks if the script is running as root.

8.  Removed memcache module since cache is used.

9.  SMTP connection test is now optional.

10. Nginx version set to 0.8.50.

11. By defult Aegir 0.4-HEAD instead of alpha13
    is now installed to fix critical issues with
    importing sites.

    See also: http://drupal.org/node/907248

12. Solr and Chive are now optional (Yes/no).

13. Added optional install of Collectd monitor.

14. Fixed issue with SSL mode.

15. Better compatibility for upgrades from
    pre-Barracuda Nginx installs.

16. Now it doesn't start cron before completing all
    install tasks to avoid breaking spinner.

17. Both Barracuda and Octopus now can better
    support re-starting stopped install/upgrade.

18. Octopus now refuses to run if defined domain
    doesn't resolve yet to the server IP address.

19. Octopus now refuses to run on system not
    created initially by Barracuda installer.

20. Custom FQDN hostname is now forced (if defined)
    in Barracuda before running DNS checks.

22. Updated versions of Open Atrium, Drupal Commons
    and Cocomore Drupal distros installed by Octopus.

23. Lowered memory defaults in the MariaDB configuration.

   and upgrade of Aegir Satellite Instances by Octopus
   finally works as expected.

2. It is now possible to use Barracuda to install
   environment and Aegir Master Instance, to
   upgrade only environment, to upgrade only Aegir
   Master Instance, or both at the same time.

3. Octopus now can separately install and/or upgrade
   any Aegir Satellite Instance or any platform
   on any instance, separately, using detailed prompt
   with version numbers and links to distributions
   home pages.

4. New platform Cocomore Drupal added in Octopus:
   http://drupal.cocomore.com


### Sat, 2010-08-28 20:15 - Edition 0.4-HEAD-A12.C

   so you can use this system even on the low end VPS.

   subdomain (may require dns entry or wildcard).
