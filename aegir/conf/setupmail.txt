Note about vanilla platforms naming convention:

  Basic Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 platforms come in three instances,
  to make your standard workflow easier for: -dev, -stage and -prod,
  with correct suffix: D.00x, S.00x and P.00x in the platform name.
  There is no difference between D/S/P, besides the name.


----------------------------------------
#2. DEPLOYING YOUR WEB SITES
----------------------------------------

The best way to get started is simply to log into the
control panel and start testing how Aegir works. We're
always ready to assist and guide you step by step, so please
don't hesitate to ask questions - we would love to help you!

Creating a new site is as easy as clicking the Add Site tab.

To make a site "live" using any domain name you manage, you
need to point its A or CNAME DNS record to your VPS address,
like below:

 yourdomain.com.           IN  A      166.84.6.231
  or
 subdomain.yourdomain.com. IN  CNAME  aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz.

You can also use any subdomain in *.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz to create
test sites, for example: http://atrium.aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz etc.


----------------------------------------
#3. ADDING MODULES & THEMES
----------------------------------------

To add modules/themes to any of the enabled platforms,
you need to log into your FTPS/SSH/SFTP account:

  host: aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz
  user: dragon.ftp
  pass: FN8rXcQn
  port: 21 (for FTPS connections)
  port: 22 (for SSH and SFTP connections)

To see all available shell commands please type "help" when
logged in via SSH.

Please change your password via SSH with "passwd" command
at least every 3 months. Otherwise the password will expire in 90 days
and you will have to log in via SSH to restore your FTPS access.

Note that while your Aegir instance comes with FTPS/SSH/SFTP access,
there is no plain FTP access available, and you must use Explicit TLS
mode with standard port 21 while connecting via FTPS (FTP over SSL).
The SFTP (FTP over SSH) connections should use port 22, unless
your Aegir instance comes with non-standard SSH port.

Compatible FTP-SSL/TLS clients are listed here:

 http://omega8.cc/dev/ftp-tls.txt

Make sure you are adding modules and themes to your expected
platform. If you experience issues, you can contact our
support department.

You can manage your databases via Chive Manager web interface,
using access credentials (dbhost, dbname and dbpass) available
in every site settings.php file.

Chive Manager URL: https://166.84.6.231

#4. ADVANCED USER INFORMATION
----------------------------------------

=== IMPORTANT DIRECTORY INFORMATION

Your home directory shows a number of sub-subdirectories in the
~/platforms directory, each one for a different platforms release,
while each platform can include modules/themes in a separate,
standard Drupal multisite directory tree.

To make it easier to find all your sites while they are created and
migrated between different platforms, you can use automatically
updated symlinks in the ~/clients/client-name/ directory.
These symlinks always point to every site directory directly.

=== IMPORTANT CUSTOM PLATFORM INFORMATION

When logged in via FTPS or SSH you'll find also a directory
named 'static'. This is the place to upload your optional
custom Drupal platform, each in a separate subdirectory,
named in the form (for example):

 ~/static/platforms/my-green-platform
 ~/static/platforms/my-yellow-platform

When you want to enable any of those custom platforms, just use
the built-in "Add platform" option in your Aegir control panel.

Please remember to use full system paths. You can check the path
with "pwd" command when logged in via SSH.

Note that we allow only Pressflow core based platforms for
5.x and 6.x Drupal versions, while 7.x platforms can use
standard Drupal 7 core.
