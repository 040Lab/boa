### IMPORTANT!

* Don't run any installer via sudo.
  You must be logged in as root or `sudo -i` first.

* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!


# Download and run BOA Meta Installer.
$ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt
$ bash BOA.sh.txt

# To upgrade system and Aegir Master Instance to Stable
$ barracuda up-stable

# To upgrade system and Aegir Master Instance to HEAD
$ barracuda up-head

# To upgrade selected Aegir Satellite Instance to Stable
$ octopus up-stable o1

# To upgrade *all* Aegir Satellite Instances to Stable
$ octopus up-stable all

# To upgrade selected Aegir Satellite Instance to HEAD
$ octopus up-head o1

# To upgrade *all* Aegir Satellite Instances to HEAD
$ octopus up-head all


   To keep Legacy version instead of Stable, use the same commands, but
   replace "up-stable" with "up-legacy".

   The Legacy version is the last Edition in the 2.1.x series which still
   supported Drupal 5 and used Drush 4 along with older Aegir version.

   Note that once you have current stable or head installed, you can't
   go back to legacy version.


### NOTE: Both commands will honor configuration settings
          stored in their config files, respectively:
            /root/.barracuda.cnf
            /root/.o1.octopus.cnf
            /root/.o2.octopus.cnf
          However, arguments specified on command line
          will take precedence - see upgrade mode below.

### NOTE: You can append "log" as a last argument to every
          command, and it will write the output to the file
          instead of to the console, respectively:
          /var/backups/reports/up/barracuda/*
          /var/backups/reports/up/octopus/*

          Examples:

          $ barracuda up-stable log
          $ octopus up-stable all log

          Detailed backend log on barracuda upgrade is always stored in
          /var/backups/*

### NOTE: You can append "system" as a last argument to the barracuda
          command, and it will upgrade only the system, without running
          Aegir Master Instance upgrade, plus it will write the output
          to the file instead of to the console:
          /var/backups/reports/up/barracuda/*

          Example:

          $ barracuda up-stable system

### NOTE: While both "log" and "system" modes are "silent", because
          they don't display anything in your console, they will send
          the log via e-mail to your address specified in the file:
          /root/.barracuda.cnf

          It is recommended that you start `screen` before running
          commands using the "silent" mode - to avoid confusion
          or incomplete tasks when your SSH connection drops.

### NOTE: It is possible to set/force the upgrade mode on the fly
          using optional arguments: {aegir|platforms|both}
          Note that none is similar to "both", however "both"
          will force aegir+platforms upgrade, while none will
          honor also settings from the octopus instance cnf file,
          where currently only "aegir" mode is defined
          with _HM_ONLY=YES option.

          Examples:

          $ octopus up-stable o1 aegir
          $ octopus up-stable o1 platforms log
          $ octopus up-stable all aegir log
          $ octopus up-stable all platforms
