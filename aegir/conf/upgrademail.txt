Hello,

Your Aegir Hosting System has been upgraded to version BOA-2.0.8 and
it includes changes from versions BOA-2.0.6 and BOA-2.0.7 released last week.

  https://aegir.dragon.ny.host8.biz


Please read this e-mail update - we have some important changes, many new
platforms and features to help you manage your Drupal sites.


=== NEW VIDEO TUTORIALS

  If you like video tutorials, start here - Matt Petrowsky explains
  how to manage your databases remotely:

  Here are his previous tutorials, if you didn't watch them yet:

=== IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THIS UPGRADE

* We are changing default PHP-FPM version used by all Drupal 6 sites to the
  new PHP-FPM 5.3.24 and deprecate PHP-FPM 5.2.17, which is now used only
  for remaining Drupal 5 sites, if hosted.

  We also no longer update/rebuild existing PHP 5.2.17 version.

  Note that we have already switched PHP-CLI used by your Aegir backend
  to 5.3 in BOA-2.0.4 Edition.

  While we believe that it is already a big time for this safe change, please
  let us know via: http://omega8.cc/support if you still need to use old
  PHP 5.2.17 version for your Drupal 6 sites.

* We have removed Drupal 5 from the list of supported platforms. We don't
  delete previously installed D5 platforms yet, but you should really upgrade
  to Drupal 6 and stop using Drupal 5.

* We have changed control files used to disable Redis cache. Previously it was
  cache/NO.txt and now it is:

    sites/all/modules/redis_cache_disable.info (platform-wide)
    sites/foo.com/modules/redis_cache_disable.info (per site)

  More details in the updated article at: http://omega8.cc/node/115

* We have changed auto-generated $cookie_domain to use dynamic HTTP_HOST
  as before, but you can still force static SERVER_NAME, which stays the same
  for all domain aliases. This may be useful when you prefer to keep users
  logged in while visiting various sub-sites managed with Domain Access
  module. The control file required to force SERVER_NAME as a base for
  $cookie_domain is:

    sites/foo.com/modules/cookie_domain.info

* We have switched from Tomcat to Jetty and we support both Solr 3.6.2 and
  previous Solr 1.4.1 version, while self-hosted instances can even use
  Solr 4.2.0. For more information please read docs/SOLR.txt
  linked on the project page: http://drupal.org/project/barracuda

* All known bots receive 24h Speed Booster cache TTL by default.


=== NEW FEATURES AND FIXES IN THIS UPGRADE

* We have added extra Drush versions available on command line as drush4,
  drush5 and drush6. Note that Aegir backend still uses Drush 4 by default.

* There is new command line tool: sqlmagic. You can use it to fix database
  dumps which can't be imported because of that "SQL SECURITY DEFINER" using
  mysql user from previous system. To get these DEFINERs removed, type:

    sqlmagic fix database.sql

  You can also use it to convert any site to/from InnoDB/MyISAM.
  Make sure you are in the correct site directory and then type:

    sqlmagic convert to-innodb
    sqlmagic convert to-myisam

* You can force three different cache TTL values for Speed Booster, used only
  for anonymous visitors, with different control files, as explained below.

  Note that default cache TTL used in Speed Booster is just 10 seconds for
  both logged in and anonymous visitors, and 24 hours for known bots.

  To force 15 minutes cache TTL, use:
    sites/all/modules/nginx_cache_quarter.info (platform-wide)
    sites/foo.com/modules/nginx_cache_quarter.info (per site)

  To force 1 hour cache TTL, use:
    sites/all/modules/nginx_cache_hour.info (platform-wide)
    sites/foo.com/modules/nginx_cache_hour.info (per site)

  To force 24 hours cache TTL, use:
    sites/all/modules/nginx_cache_day.info (platform-wide)
    sites/foo.com/modules/nginx_cache_day.info (per site)

  You should use AdvAgg module to avoid broken CSS/layout when you force
  longer cache TTL in the Speed Booster.

* You can also configure Speed Booster cache TTL in the local.settings.php
  extra config file, which allows you to force completely custom TTL per URL
  with some PHP/regex, and if/else logic, by sending desired individual
  header('X-Accel-Expires: xyx'); - where xyz is a TTL in seconds.

* Redis now supports Fast Lock Backend feature in Drupal 6 and 7, which
  replaces Drupal own, SQL database based lock mechanism, but it is not
  enabled by default. To enable this feature, you would need to create
  an empty control file:

    sites/all/modules/redis_lock_enable.info (platform-wide)
    sites/foo.com/modules/redis_lock_enable.info (per site)

* You can easily whitelist your IP on the firewall to avoid being blocked
  because of too many HTTP requests. Sometimes it may happen when there is
  essentially no traffic on the instance besides your requests/pageviews
  and/or when there is more than one person actively working on the same
  server from the same IP address.

  To avoid that please log in via SSH (on command line) and keep the session
  active with command like "ping foo.bar.com" - otherwise it will disconnect
  you after 15 minutes of inactivity - and it will whitelist your IP address
  on the fly for as long as you are logged in.

  Note that this whitelisting is not a full whitelisting - it just increases
  the allowed HTTP requests treshold to avoid unintended self-blocking, but
  it may still block you temporarily after too many failed SSH or FTPS login
  attempts, or when you flood the server with never cached POST requests etc.

  This feature has been suggested by Matt Petrowsky - thanks Matt!

* All important passwords, like for mysql root and Aegir system user are
  re-generated on every upgrade. All self-hosted instances, while by default
  still use standard random passwords, may optionally use _STRONG_PASSWORDS=YES
  (which is default in our hosted service) for even better protection, after
  testing that both "randpass 32 esc" and "randpass 32 alnum" commands produce
  well looking, strong passwords and not a binary garbage, which is a sign of
  probably broken or unreliable system /dev/urandom.
