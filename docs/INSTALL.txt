### IMPORTANT!
#
* Don't run both installers via sudo. You must be logged in as root. Or sudo -i first.
* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer. You should use vanilla system.
* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!


### Installing Barracuda (main system and Aegir Master Instance):
#
$ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/versions/BARRACUDA.sh.txt (Stable)
$ wget -q -U iCab http://code.aegir.cc/aegir/barracuda-octopus/blobs/raw/master/BARRACUDA.sh.txt (HEAD)
$ nano BARRACUDA.sh.txt (enter your valid e-mail address and hostname)
$ bash BARRACUDA.sh.txt


### Installing Octopus (Aegir Satellite Instance):
#
#   Optional: If in addition you want an Aegir Satellite Instance(s) preloaded with platforms
#             you will need to run OCTOPUS.sh.txt after running BARRACUDA.sh.txt
#             It is higly recommended because many BOA-specific enhancements are available
#             out-of-the-box only in the Satellite Instances.
#
$ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/versions/OCTOPUS.sh.txt (Stable)
$ wget -q -U iCab http://code.aegir.cc/aegir/barracuda-octopus/blobs/raw/master/OCTOPUS.sh.txt (HEAD)
$ nano OCTOPUS.sh.txt (enter your valid e-mail address)
$ bash OCTOPUS.sh.txt
