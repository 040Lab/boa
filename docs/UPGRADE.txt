### IMPORTANT!

* Don't run any installer via sudo.
  You must be logged in as root or `sudo -i` first.

* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Please never use HEAD version on any production server. Always use Stable.
  The HEAD can be occasionally broken and should be used **only** for testing!


# Download and run BOA Meta Installer.
$ wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/versions/BOA.sh.txt
$ bash BOA.sh.txt

# To upgrade system and Aegir Master Instance to Stable
$ barracuda up-stable

# To upgrade system and Aegir Master Instance to HEAD
$ barracuda up-head

# To upgrade selected Aegir Satellite Instance to Stable
$ octopus up-stable o1

# To upgrade *all* Aegir Satellite Instances to Stable
$ octopus up-stable all

# To upgrade selected Aegir Satellite Instance to HEAD
$ octopus up-head o1

# To upgrade *all* Aegir Satellite Instances to HEAD
$ octopus up-head all


### NOTE: Both commands will honor configuration settings
          stored in their config files, respectively:
            /root/.barracuda.cnf
            /root/.o1.octopus.cnf
            /root/.o2.octopus.cnf
          However, arguments specified on command line
          will take precedence - see upgrade mode below.

### NOTE: You can append "log" as a last argument to every
          command, and it will write the output to the file
          instead of to the console, respectively:
          /var/backups/reports/up/barracuda/*
          /var/backups/reports/up/octopus/*

          Examples:

          $ barracuda up-stable log
          $ octopus up-stable all log

          Note also that detailed backend log on barracuda
          upgrade is always stored directly in /var/backups/*

### NOTE: It is possible to set/force the upgrade mode on the fly
          using optional arguments: {aegir|platforms|both}
          Note that none is similar to "both", however "both"
          will force aegir+platforms upgrade, while none will
          honor also settings from the octopus instance cnf file,
          where currently only "aegir" mode is defined
          with _HM_ONLY=YES option.
          
          Examples:

          $ octopus up-stable o1 aegir
          $ octopus up-stable o1 platforms log
          $ octopus up-stable all aegir log
          $ octopus up-stable all platforms
